Welcome to my complete Walkthrough to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U,
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Skylanders: Swap Force. This walkthrough
is based off the PlayStation 3 version primarily so some parts may be slightly
different if you're on other consoles, however the majority of things should be
identical. Wii users may find significant differences.

The walkthrough itself tries not assume you have any specific Skylanders and
will mention when you need a certain element or ability to complete a task. The
only requirement to get through the story is to have a Skylander, any element
or size will do. The more Skylanders you have the easier it'll be and the more
you'll be able to do.

Every time you defeat an enemy they will drop a load of small glowing dots,
collect them by walking close. These will fill up the bar at the bottom of your
Skylander's portrait, once it reaches the edge your Skylander will level up.
Levelling up has a few side effects, one is that some enemies around you may be
killed by the powerful burst of energy released, your Skylander's maximum
health will increase and you will also regain a bit of health.

Your attacks and powers do not get stronger with a higher level character, only
your health. To increase your other stats you will need to use Legendary
Treasures, Charms, complete Bonus Missions or just equip a Hat.

Each level requires more and more experience to earn, in Skylanders: Swap Force
you can go up to a maximum of level 20. This new level cap also applies to any
Skylanders you used in Spyro's Adventure and Giants so they're not stuck behind
the newer characters in terms of health.

 ,--------,                      ,----------,                       ,--------,

 '--------'                      '----------'                       '--------'

Throughout the levels you will find many coins in various shapes, sizes, and
values to pick up, these are stored on your Skylander and can only be used by
the Skylander that picked them up. Coins can be found in various smashable
items such as barrels, bones, carts, and vases.

You can also find coins in larger quantities in special Treasure Chests that
are in a limited number per level, these are usually hidden off the main path
and require you to explore or solve an optional puzzle to reach. You may need a
specific element Skylander or a Giant to reach some of these.

Once you have finished the first chapter of the game you will be able to visit
Gorm in Woodburrow and use the Upgrade Pod behind him, you will then also find
these Upgrade Pods at around about the halfway point through a level near the
Checkpoint. A single Winged Sapphire can be found in each regular level
(Adventure Pack levels and Woodburrow have two), each of these reduce the cost
by 2% (totalling a 36% discount).

Each core Skylander has four basic upgrades before you have to choose a path to
go down, these paths usually mean focusing on one of the Skylander's core
abilities and making it even stronger. For Series 1 Skylanders this choice is
permanent so choose carefully. Once a Series 2 or 3 Skylander has chosen a path
an option will appear at the bottom of the screen that lets you switch paths
again, you must buy the upgrades for each path individually.

For the toys that cannot switch paths in-game the only way to switch paths
after choosing one is to fully reset the toy. This loses all experience, coins,
upgrades, quests, hats, heroic challenges and its nickname. Not ideal.

There is also a special upgrade that requires you to find that Skylander's
"Soul Gem". A Soul Gem is a token that you will find hidden somewhere in a
specific level - selecting the ability on the upgrade screen will tell you
which. Unfortunately even after finding the Soul Gem it costs money to actually
use it, it's not free. You can collect Soul Gems for Skylanders that you don't
own (yet) and preview them with a short video. You only need to find Soul Gems
for the 32 new Skylanders, all of the ones for the previous sets of characters
are unlocked for you already.

Series 2 and 3 toys (not LightCores) also have access to an extra ability
compared to their Series 1 counterparts, this "Wow Pow" costs 5000 gold and can
be bought at any point - though some do require another specific upgrade to be
bought first. A Series 3 version of character has a new Wow Pow to that of the
Series 2 version and does not have the Series 2's Wow Pow.

 ,--------,                        ,-------,                        ,--------,

 '--------'                        '-------'                        '--------'

Each Skylander has a base set of stats.

   ,------------------------------------------,
  | [010401]      Maximum Health      [010401] |
   '------------------------------------------'

This is the maximum amount of health that your Skylander has. To improve this
simply level up your character. It will mean you can take more hits before
dying.

   ,---------------------------------,
  | [010402]      Speed      [010402] |
   '---------------------------------'

How fast your Skylander walks around. This stat also affects abilities such as
flying or charging.

   ,---------------------------------,
  | [010403]      Armor      [010403] |
   '---------------------------------'

This reduces the damage taken by a hit, the higher armor you have the less
damage you'll take. This is a change to the behaviour seen in previous games
where it was a small chance to completely block damage.

   ,----------------------------------------,
  | [010404]      Critical Hit      [010404] |
   '----------------------------------------'

The higher this is the more often your attacks will hit with a larger number
than usual. When it does take effect your attack will be 1.5 times its normal
number. So something that would usually hit for 26 damage would on a crit hit
for 39 damage. There is a stat called Critical Hit Multiplier that increases
the amount of damage a critical hit does.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [010405]      Elemental Power      [010405] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

Increases how much extra damage your Skylander does in their elemental areas,
it is a direct percentage bonus. So with 50 Elemental Power an attack that
normally does 20 damage would do 30 damage instead.

 ,--------,                       ,--------,                        ,--------,
| [010500] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Quests  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-| [010500] |
 '--------'                       '--------'                        '--------'

Each Skylander keeps track of its progress through nine individual "quests".
Five of them are the same for all characters, three specific to the Skylander's
element and one specific to the character.

If you completed the Quests in Giants you will find that this progress does not
show up in Swap Force as these are a completely separate system despite several
of them being identical. You will however have your previous rank displayed at
the bottom right of the Quests page and can therefore have two quest icons when
you put the Skylander on the Portal.

 ,--------,                        ,------,                         ,--------,
| [010600] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-|  Hats  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~| [010600] |
 '--------'                        '------'                         '--------'

In each level you can find hats in presents, these are special items that boost
your Skylander's stats slightly when worn. Most hats are found behind elemental
gates so you will need a Skylander of specific elements to get a lot of the
hats. You can also buy hats from a store in Woodburrow, they are all locked
away behind their own Portal Master rank requirements.

 ,--------,                  ,-------------------,                  ,--------,
| [010700] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-|  Heroic Challenges  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-| [010700] |
 '--------'                  '-------------------'                  '--------'

These do not exist in Swap Force, however if you have completed them in the
previous games you will see a small boost to your stats in Swap Force depending
on how many of them you have done.

 ,--------,                   ,-----------------,                   ,--------,
| [010800] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Elemental Gates  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~| [010800] |
 '--------'                   '-----------------'                   '--------'

In each level you will find a few elemental gates, these are entirely optional
and by skipping them you do not hinder progress through the story. To open an
elemental gate simply stand near to it with a Skylander of the corresponding
element.

If you are playing co-op and one player goes through a portal with a whirlpool,
whirlwind, or exhaust vent the other player will be dragged in too. You do not
need both characters to be the matching element, just one will do.

Behind elemental gates you will usually find a small puzzle or set of obstacles
to get past to reach a Present with an item inside.

New to Swap Force are Dual Gates, these require two different elements to open.
You can either do that with a single Swappable character having one part as one
of the elements and the other as the other, or you can play co-op with two
Skylanders and have both elements that way.

 ,--------,                     ,------------,                      ,--------,
| [010900] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Swap Zones  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-| [010900] |
 '--------'                     '------------'                      '--------'

In every level you'll find these new Swap Zones which are like Elemental Gates
but instead of an element required to use you need a specific swap ability.
There are eight types of ability: Climb, Spin, Speed, Sneak, Teleport, Rocket,
Bounce, and Dig.

 ,--------,                     ,-------------,                     ,--------,
| [011000] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Star Rating  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~| [011000] |
 '--------'                     '-------------'                     '--------'

When you finish a chapter you will be shown a summary screen of your completion
of the level's objectives. Each checkmark only needs to be gotten once and then
it stays checked permanently, there's no need to get every single thing in one
playthrough.

The first star "Story Goals" is pretty much a given that you'll earn upon
completing a level.

The second star "Dares" is how well you've done in the level itself, these can
be completed without any specific Skylander types or elements.

    * Each level has a set of missing items that need to be found, these are
      different for each level.
    * There's also Enemy Goal which requires you to kill a specific number of
      enemies within the level.
    * And No Skylanders Defeated simply requires for you to play through the
      entire level without having any of your Skylanders be defeated.

The third star is "Collections". Each level has a specific number of Areas to
discover and plenty of things to find. There's Treasure Chests, Soul Gems,
Legendary Treasures, Hats, Bonus Mission Maps, Winged Sapphires and a Story
Scroll. You will need to go through all of the Elemental Gates and Swap Zones
in a level to complete this star.

 ,--------,                   ,-----------------,                   ,--------,
| [011100] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Adventure Packs  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~| [011100] |
 '--------'                   '-----------------'                   '--------'

There are two brand new Adventure Packs with Swap Force: Tower of Time and
Sheep Wreck Island. The Adventure Packs released with Skylanders: Spyro's
Adventure will not unlock their levels (or even their arenas) in Swap Force but
can still be used as Magic Items.

The new Location Pieces when placed on the Portal of Power will unlock a brand
new level as well as a battle arena for your PvP fights. It can then also be
used as a weapon, place it on the Portal during a fight and you will get some
kind of special attack that is quite deadly. This ability will work once in a
level, resetting when you go into another one.

The Magic Items do not unlock anything but instead temporarily provide your
Skylanders with something special. The main thing is to remember to actually
use them.

 ,--------,                    ,---------------,                    ,--------,
| [011200] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-|  Tower of Time  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-| [011200] |
 '--------'                    '---------------'                    '--------'

Tower of Time unlocks the "Tower of Time" level as well as the PvP Ring Out
arena "Tic Toc Terrace". As a Magic Item it does repeated 12 damage to nearby
enemies before exploding after five seconds, doing 125 damage each.

Battle Hammer is a large hammer that floats above your Skylander's head, it
smashes into the ground doing 25 damage each time you use your primary attack.

Sky Diamond for 45 seconds gives you a bonus 20 coins upon defeating an enemy.
Make sure to pick up the gems before the time runs out as they'll vanish.

 ,--------,                 ,--------------------,                  ,--------,
| [011300] |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~|  Sheep Wreck Island  |~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-| [011300] |
 '--------'                 '--------------------'                  '--------'

Sheep Wreck Island unlocks the "Sheep Wreck Island" level as well as the
Survival arenas "Vortex Banquet", "Cyclops Makeover", "Sheep Mage Rage", and
"Chunky Chompies". As a Magic Item it spawns a sheep that does 15 damage every
second for about 45 seconds. Unlike other Adventure Pieces it does not have a
massive explosion.

Platinum Sheep disguises you as a sheep for 15 seconds healing you 15 health
each second. Enemies will not attack you while disguised.

Groove Machine plays a tune for 45 and any enemies near the gramophone will
dance and not attack you. If the Groove Machine is sitting too far away from
the enemies then move closer to them and it should teleport to try to follow
you.

  | [011301]      Empire of Ice      [011301] |
   '-----------------------------------------'

Empire of Ice does many bursts of 12 damage to nearby enemies for five seconds
before exploding and dealing 125 damage to each enemy.

Anvil Rain for 45 seconds brings down a rain of anvils that can do 15 damage to
nearby enemies if they are hit.

Sky Iron Shield creates a trio of shields that swirl around your character that
halves the damage you take for 45 seconds.

Pirate Seas does many bursts of 12 damage to nearby enemies for five seconds
before exploding and dealing 125 damage to each enemy.

Hidden Treasure's timer is actually a radar that fills up the closer you get to
a Treasure Chest that's hidden in the story level that you're in. You can find
multiple hidden chests throughout a level, if you know where they are already
you can just put the magic item on the portal when you reach the preset
locations. While this item is useful in Score Mode it is useless in Time
Attack.

There is an alternate treasure chest item called the Platinum Treasure Chest,
unfortunately the game cannot actually distinguish the difference between it
and the regular chest and will not unlock the Platinum one in your "Other Toys"
collection page. There are exactly the same number of chests in a level even if
you switch between the two items.

The Ghost Pirate Swords cause a couple of giant swords to fly around the screen
attacking nearby enemies for 45 seconds.

Darklight Crypt does many bursts of 12 damage to nearby enemies for five
seconds before exploding and dealing 125 damage to each enemy.

Time Twister slows down all nearby enemies for about 50 seconds.

Healing Elixier heals your Skylanders, it can only heal so much per level so
use wisely - it will still count down even if your Skylanders are at full
health. It will heal 30 health every second for twelve seconds, so it can
restore a total of 360 health.

Sparx the Dragonfly buzzes around your Skylanders for 45 seconds shooting
things using his fireball attack. Enemies that he kills turn into butterflies
that you can eat to regain 10 health.

A slightly less exciting version of the Adventure Pack item, instead of
unlocking a level this simply unlocks an extra PvP Battle Arena. The Battle
Packs from Giants do not unlock arenas, they are just Magic Items.

Dragonfire Cannon is a cannon that teleports around after your character
focusing attacks on a single enemy until it's defeated, it does 30 damage every
few seconds and lasts for 45 seconds.

Scorpion Strike Catapult is a catapult that teleports around after your
character focusing attacks on a single enemy until it's defeated. It throws its
projectile at an enemy doing 12 damage if it hits it, the projectile then waits
a few seconds and explodes doing another 10 damage to any enemies next to it.

Fiery Forge is a large cauldron that floats around above your head, it pours a
large pool of molten lava onto the floor that does 50 damage to each enemy that
it hits. This lasts for about 45 seconds and pours about every four to five
seconds. It also unlocks the Fiery Forge Battle Arena and Ring Out arena.

Arkeyan Crossbow is a large crossbow that sits on the ground firing at enemies
every few seconds, it does 40 damage per hit and lasts 45 seconds. It also
unlocks the Survival arenas "Sand Castle", "Beach Breach", "Troll Beach Attack"
and "Chompy Tsunami" as well as the Battle Arena "Treacherous Beach".

Once the cutscene finishes you'll be asked to place a Skylander on your Portal
of Power, you can use any one you like. Your first task is to clear the
wreckage from the ship, use your attacks to destroy it all. Once that's clear
some enemy Chompies will appear. These are probably the weakest of enemies
you'll encounter through the game they only take a tiny bit of damage to kill
but there are usually quite a few of them so the issue is watching out for all
of them at the same time. Just keep attacking until they stop appearing.

A Greeble will be the next type of enemy to appear shortly afterwards, these
take a few more hits but aren't much more of a threat than the Chompies thanks
to there being fewer of them. Try not to stand still attacking it but instead
attack and then move once it starts to raise its mace into the air, it'll smash
it down in front of it so if you're behind it it won't do any damage.

Now that you're off the ship the first thing to do is to turn around and head
away from Flynn and Tessa, if you move towards the screen you'll find the first
of [Flynn's Missing Stuff 1/5], this is your first example of a new type of
collectable for the console games (the 3DS levels often had something similar)
a set of items that you need to find in order to help complete the "Dares"
Objectives star. In this case it's five things that Flynn has lost which are
now scattered through the level. Once you've found one it stays found so if you
were to only some of the items and came back to the level later those same
items would already be collected and you would only need to find the ones you'd
missed. You do get a small amount of coins for picking up one of these items
but the main reason is to find them is to get the star.

Anyway, once you've picked up the missing stuff by walking into it head towards
Flynn and Tessa over by the ship, you will find that you'll need to jump up the
little ledge that you had been standing on before to reach them though. That's
new, jumping, the way to go about the jumping in this game is to make sure to
keep your character moving normally as you press the jump button otherwise
you'll just jump on the spot and go nowhere.

Follow the path to the right where the floating coins lead you, almost
immediately you'll need to jump up a ledge. Press the jump button while
continuing to move in the same direction to get up there.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020101]      The Overgrowth (Fire)      [020101] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Heading right you'll encounter the first elemental boost. This one's for the
Fire element, you don't have to use a Skylander of the boost element but your
damage is increased if you do. The character in the Starter Pack that applies
here is Blast Zone, use him (or just half of him and half of another swappable
Skylander) to get the bonus applied. When you attack enemies you'll see the
damage with an elemental background, the number will be larger than you'd get
if you weren't in an elemental zone (the amount it's raised by is based on your
Skylander's Elemental Power stat).

Jump up the ledges to the right and you'll reach a bamboo fence blocking your
way, use your attacks to smash through it and reach the cage behind it.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020102]      Trapping Pit (Fire)      [020102] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

Now for some enemies to use your elemental boost on if you've decided to put a
Fire Skylander on the portal. Though as it's just a few Chompies that appear
you won't really need it as are they each defeated in a single hit anyway. Once
they've all been killed the monster gate will open and let you through.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [020103]      Tangled Thicket (Fire)      [020103] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

If you go down to the left you'll see a [Treasure Chest 1/3], approach it and
press the button that the game prompts you to, this will raise the chest into
the air and ask you to rapidly tap a button to shake it open. Once all three
padlocks are shaken off it'll open and spew treasure all over the place for you
to collect. You'll want to find these Treasure Chests in each level as they
count towards the "Collections" Objectives star.

Go up the ramp on the right side to talk to Tessa by the cages, there's nothing
you can do to help here so move on past up to the left where there's a new type
of enemy to be introduced to. The Greeble Screwball is a Greeble type enemy who
has a handheld cannon, he'll fire it up into the air towards your current
position. If you move away from the red marker that appears it should miss you,
just try not to jump into the projectile when you're doing so. Attack him and
move out of the red circle each time it appears to stay safe.

Once he's defeated carry on to the left past him, ignore the stepped cages and
instead go around the back of the large rock, you should find [Flynn's Missing
Stuff 2/5], it looks a bit different to the other item you picked up but it's
part of the same collection. Once you've got it jump up the red cages that were
behind the Greeble Screwball and onto the path above them.

The game will remind you that you can switch Skylanders but it's not forcing
you to, keep your same Skylander on if you want. Kill the two Greebles that run
towards you across the stone bridge then smash through the bamboo fence between
you and the cages. To help Ms. Poppy down you need to go to the lever in the
middle of the tree, press the Interact button and then spin it around.

Use the intact cages at the back to jump up and onto another bridge. Attack the
three Chompies that approach but watch out for the Greeble Screwball's attacks
that are being fired at you. Kill it and then go to the right where there's an
arrow pointing at a large floating key. Pick it up and take it across the last
bridge to a large locked barrier. With the key in tow press the Interact button
to open the lock.

Time to learn of the elemental gates. The first one by Mr. Yappy is a new type
of elemental gate, a dual elemental gate. What this needs is for you to either
use a swappable Skylander with a Water half and a Fire half (doesn't matter
which way round, so with the Starter Pack that'd be either Wash Zone or Blast
Buckler) or to be playing co-op mode and have the two elements over the two
Skylanders (so one could be half Fire half Life and the other one Water).
Approach the gate with the relevant Skylanders to open it up. Once it's open
you can use any element you like inside.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Canopy Hot Springs (Water)                                                |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The dual element areas only have one elemental bonus however, this one's  |
 | Water. While there are no enemies in here to take advantage of that fact  |
 | there is another property of the Elemental Gates' elemental zone that     |
 | takes place, if you have the matching element active that Skylander will  |
 | every few seconds heal a small amount of health. Useful for restoring the |
 | health of nearly defeated Skylanders, albeit quite slowly.                |
 |                                                                           |
 | This area has a lot of bounce pads, they all just have coins above them   |
 | but some are also required to get further through the zone. Go forwards   |
 | and to the right and use the steam jet bounce pad thing to get up to the  |
 | platform above, then jump up to where there's a rotating blast of air.    |
 | This one won't damage you directly but it will push you so you may find   |
 | yourself getting pushed away from the direction you're wanting to go. In  |
 | this case it's to the back right bounce pad.                              |
 |                                                                           |
 | Jump up to the left and then again up to another rotating blaster, this   |
 | one has three jets coming out of it. The path seems like it slightly      |
 | diverges now but up the righthand bounce pad is just more treasure. The   |
 | place you'll want to go mainly is forwards at the back. You'll reach      |
 | another platform above where there's a red present sitting on the ground, |
 | approach it and Interact with it before shaking it open. Inside is a      |
 | [Legendary Treasure 1/1] called "Mostly Magic Mirror", Legendary          |
 | Treasures are something that you can use later on in the game but for the |
 | moment are just for collecting.                                           |
 |                                                                           |
 | Jump up to the large ring with an arrow pointing at it and press the      |
 | Interact button to be teleported right back to the start of the Elemental |
 | Gate.                                                                     |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

If you go up to the left now you'll find a second Elemental Gate, this one's
for the Life element so in your Starter Pack that should be Ninja Stealth Elf's
job to open but of course any other Life Skylander (or half a Life Skylander)
will do the trick just as well.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Prickly Pastures (Life)                                                   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Already contradicting the conversation you had before entering the        |
 | previous gate you'll find somebody already in here, talk to Little Bro    |
 | Pete to get the Rescue the Missing Sheep task. To do that you need to get |
 | to the cages they're in first, walk towards the set of spikes that keep   |
 | popping out of the ground and wait for them to go back down before        |
 | quickly moving over them. As long as you're not directly on them when     |
 | they pop out you should be fine.                                          |
 |                                                                           |
 | Jump up the ledges towards the sheep cage and then smash the cage open    |
 | with your attacks. Lt. Woalf will introduce himself, he's not really      |
 | anything more than a Greeble Screwball though. Go left across another     |
 | spike trap and then up the ledges to where there's a regular Greeble      |
 | Screwball guarding a sheep cage, get rid of him and smash the cage open.  |
 | Now carry on forwards through several sets of spikes, watch out for the   |
 | two attacking Screwballs as you pause to not get spiked.                  |
 |                                                                           |
 | Jump up the ledges to reach the two Screwballs, Lt. Woalf doesn't even    |
 | take any more damage to defeat so as long as you're watching the red      |
 | circles it shouldn't be much more trouble than a single Screwball. Once   |
 | you've freed the last of the sheep you'll be teleported back to Pete and  |
 | given a present to shake open, inside is [Hat 1/3 - Stovepipe Hat]. Hats  |
 | can be worn by any number of Skylanders at the same time and give your    |
 | Skylander a small boost in their stats. In this case it's +5 Armor, +2    |
 | Critical Hit and +5 Elemental Power. If you want to remove the hat you    |
 | can go into the Skylander Menu, select Hats and then press the Remove Hat |
 | button listed at the bottom of the screen.                                |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Back out from the Elemental Gates continue forwards over a small stone bridge.

   ,-------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020104]      Old Treetop Terrace (Earth)      [020104] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

The active element here is not one you get in the Starter Pack (although you do
in the Dark Edition Starter Pack, Dark Slobber Tooth) but remember that it's
only a suggestion and not in any way a requirement. Smash through the bamboo
fence and then jump up the cages. At the top you'll find the first block puzzle
of the game, to push the block take a look at the arrow on top of it, that
shows the direction that it is able to be pushed (although sometimes there'll
be another block blocking that direction), approach the block and simply walk
into it to push it, no buttons required. Push it three times until it falls
into the gap and forms a little bridge for you to get across.

There's a spiky purple glowing circle floating up on a small rock ahead of you,
this is a Soul Gem, to reach it all you need to do is push the left of the two
blocks forwards twice into a small dip, this will give you space to jump up
onto the block and then up onto the rock platform to pick up [Soul Gem 1/2 -
Pop Thorn]. Soul Gems are the most expensive upgrade for a Skylander, once
you've found a particular Skylander's Soul Gem you will be able to purchase
that upgrade and use it, if you haven't found the Soul Gem you won't be able to
buy it even if you have enough money. Pop Thorn is a character that is sold
seperately, at the time of writing he is only found in the Tower of Time
Adventure Pack. It doesn't matter if you don't have the relevant Skylander as
finding all the Soul Gems in a level counts towards the "Collections"
Objectives star. Finding the Soul Gem will also let you see a quick video
showing off Pop Thorn if you want.

Jump back down and push the right block to the right so you can use it to get
over the gap behind it. Go over the stone bridge but stop and go to the right
before going over the second one, down there you'll find [Flynn's Missing Stuff
3/5] to pick up. Once you've got it jump back up and carry on over the bridge,
kill the three patrolling Chompies as well as the two Screwballs firing at you
from afar.

Jump up to the right and you'll find the game's first [Story Scroll]. These are
found in each level and give a little bit of extra story behind some of the
places and creatures that are a part of the Skylands, they also reward you with
a bit of experience just for picking them up. Follow the path to the left and
you'll reach an entirely new type of zone that Fleesly will introduce you to, a
SWAP Zone. This first one is a Rocket zone so requires a swappable Skylander
with Rocket legs. So from the Starter Pack that'll be the legs of Blast Zone
combined with any top half you like.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Forest Flyby (Rocket)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The SWAP Zones are mini-games where you use the special ability of a      |
 | Skylander's bottom half to play. Rocket mini-games are about flying       |
 | through rings before the time runs out, there's plenty of obstacles like  |
 | mines in the way to try to stop you. To make it in time you're going to   |
 | want to be boosting almost the entire way, just keep the boost button     |
 | held down to do that. Weave through the fiery rock balls to safely make   |
 | it to each ring before the timer runs down, you'll get a small boost to   |
 | your time when you reach a ring but it is just that, a boost, so if       |
 | you're only one second away from running out of time you'll probably      |
 | still be struggling to reach the next one too.                            |
 |                                                                           |
 | In each SWAP Zone there are also three special red gems that you can      |
 | collect, all they are is just bonus gems awarded once you reach the end   |
 | of the zone so no real need to go out of your way to collect them (during |
 | the standalone versions of each SWAP Zone they are turned into Medals     |
 | which you do need to collect all of in order to get a star but that's not |
 | applicable right now). The zone is sort of cut into three parts where you |
 | can find a bit of food to heal up from any damage taken but you won't     |
 | want to hang around at the refreshment points as the timer still counts   |
 | down.                                                                     |
 |                                                                           |
 | If you lose all your health or run out of time you get transported back   |
 | out to the beginning but without any reward, the bonus gems you may have  |
 | picked up won't give you anything. Damage taken in here does not defeat   |
 | or tire out your Skylander in the same way as it would in the rest of the |
 | level so you can just keep on trying until you win (if you're having      |
 | trouble with damage you may want to lower the difficulty as that lowers   |
 | the amount of damage dealt to you from hitting things) or just give up    |
 | and carry on with the level.                                              |
 |                                                                           |
 | Once you finally reach the end of the zone with life and time left you    |
 | get transported back out into the level where you'll be awarded with a    |
 | present to shake open [Hat 2/3 - Greeble Hat] and be given the bonus gems |
 | you've found. It also unlocks the SWAP Zone Challenge for this zone.      |
 |                                                                           |
 | Note that SWAP Zones do not count towards the "Areas Discovered" part of  |
 | the Collections Objectives so if you're missing something there it's not  |
 | from a SWAP Zone.                                                         |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Opposite the SWAP Zone is a lowered platform with a [Treasure Chest 2/3] on it.
Jump back up once you've shaken it open and smash through the bamboo fence
blocking your way. Tessa will pop up to remind you of your quest and talk about
a vine, this is an example of an obstacle that helps to separate each level
into several parts, once you go down it you won't be able to backtrack up it
and get the stuff earlier on in the level. Once you're ready step onto it,
press the Interact button and then rapidly tap the button that the game prompts
you to, you can back out if you don't press anything or press it enough times
in the time it gives you. This first vine doesn't have any obstacles to damage
you, just lines of coins that you can try to jump to collect, they're not worth
much so don't get too concerned with grabbing them all.

Go up the stone bridge to meet another type of enemy, the Chompy Pod. These are
large stationary enemies that don't do anything except create new Chompies to
attack you. They'll keep on doing that until you destroy them. Before moving on
past the Chompy Pod however you will want to go to the left off the side of the
tree trunk and down to a yellow glowing cave in the side of it.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020105]      Honey Trove (Earth)      [020105] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

This cave is entirely optional to do as it just has optional collectables at
the end of the obstacles. Push the bottom cage forwards and then jump up and
push the left one to the right where the first had been. You can now use it to
jump up to the right, go left across the stone bridge and push the cage to the
left three times so you can get past it. Behind it is [Soul Gem 2/2 - Magna
Charge], so pick that up and then push the cage back across the bridge, six
pushes will do it. Once it's as far right as it'll go push it forwards twice
into the dip so you can use it to get up to [Flynn's Missing Stuff 4/5]. To
leave the cave you have to go back down and through the entrance again.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020106]      Long Worn Hollow (Earth)      [020106] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Moving past where the Chompy Pod was head left through a bamboo fence to find
an Air Gate. This is an element not found in the Starter Pack (not even the
Dark Edition one) so you'll have to use another of your collection to get in
here.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Bulwark Overlook (Air)                                                    |

 | There's not much to this zone except the cannon up by Wixxon. Interact    |
 | with it and start firing at the bombers flying past. They will fire       |
 | missiles at you so that should really be your main focus with hitting the |
 | bombers themselves as second. You won't run out of bombers to shoot but   |
 | your health is limited, and, unlike the SWAP Zones, getting defeated in   |
 | here does make your Skylander "tired" and unusable in the rest of the     |
 | level. Remember that you only need a specific element to open the gate,   |
 | any Skylander can play this shooting mini-game so perhaps try using one   |
 | with a lot of health if you keep getting hit.                             |
 |                                                                           |
 | Beating this earns you a Winged Sapphire. This blue flying gem gives you  |
 | a 2% discount on purchases, it might not sound a lot but when you have    |
 | several of these it really adds up.                                       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up the stone bridge to the right and then over the second bridge to get to
some cage blocks. Push the back one to the right and then the front one towards
the screen off the edge, push the remaining one forwards but then turn around
and jump down following the one you just pushed off towards the screen (or drop
off to the right side to land on a small amount of extra coins). You'll land
right next to it, push it forwards so that it drops into the little dip and
lets you jump up to the last of [Flynn's Missing Stuff 5/5]. There's no
particular reward for finding them all except for helping towards the Dare
star.

Head into the honey cave to your right.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020107]      Canopy Cave (Earth)      [020107] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

Watch out for the Screwballs in here as you jump up the platforms to the top at
the back where there's a gap to jump over before reaching [Treasure Chest 3/3]
next to one of the Screwballs.

On the way up you may have noticed a large safe with a glowing blue Tree Rex
head on the front of it, this is an indicator that only a Giant Skylander, a
type of Skylander introduced in the previous game Skylanders: Giants, can
unlock the chest. Do not worry if you don't have a Giant though as it is not
required for any part of the star completion for a level and all it has inside
is a few coins. Once you've placed a Giant next to the safe and the Giant icon
has disappeared you can remove it and use any Skylander to actually open it and
get the coins.

Exit the cave and go up the slope to the left to get back onto the stone bridge
you crossed earlier. Ignore the little step made out of the cage you pushed
before and continue to the right where there's a Climbing SWAP Zone. The
Starter Pack Skylander Wash Buckler has the required ability in its legs as you
can see by the ladder icon on the base.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Tree Top Jaunt (Climb)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Climb Zones are a vertical climb where you need to avoid falling debris   |
 | in order to reach the top. There's no time limit, the only thing keeping  |
 | you from winning is losing you health to the falling objects. Make sure   |
 | to use all of the barriers to wait and watch for times when it is safe to |
 | run to the next barrier, Wall Dash can help get through the smaller gaps  |
 | but it is not something you need to be using all the time like you had to |
 | in the Rocket zone. The bonus gems also fall so if they get past you      |
 | you're unlikely to be able to catch up, there's one to each section so    |
 | once you've seen one you can stop looking out for them until you get to   |
 | the next food break.                                                      |
 |                                                                           |
 | Once you reach the top you unlock the level in the menu and earn yourself |
 | a present with a [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Fruit Fight] inside. A Bonus    |
 | Mission is similar to the Heroic Challenges of the previous games but,    |
 | instead of needing every single Skylander to do it in order to earn the   |
 | bonus for each of them, you only need to complete it once. You can keep   |
 | trying to improve your score but it won't have any additional benefit     |
 | beyond the three stars you can earn from it.                              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Now use that cage block you pushed earlier to get up to the path headed
forwards over a stone bridge and through a bamboo fence. There's a couple of
Greebles and a Chompy Pod to get rid of before advancing through to another
cage area, walk up to the lever in the middle and spin it to lower the cages.
The honey cave this time is required to go in, the key you'll need is in there.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [020108]      Gold Hewn Basin      [020108] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

Kill the two Greeble Screwballs in here as you make your way up the right
platforms to jump over to the left and pick up the key at the top. And that's
it in here, head back out the entrance and jump up the cages to the locked
gate.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020109]      Knotted Heights (Water)      [020109] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Take out the two Screwballs beyond the gate and advance forwards to the vine,
get on it and start sliding. Again there's not much to it beyond a few jumps to
grab coins. Once you land you can either go into the Dig SWAP Zone or continue
right. Dig isn't a type you get with the Starter Pack so you'll have to have
bought either Grilla Drilla or Rubble Rouser to get in.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Spiky Pit (Dig)                                                           |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Drill SWAP Zones are more of a platforming zone than the others so far,   |
 | you need to make your way towards the three blue crystals buried in the   |
 | ground, to make it harder only nearby is it light, the rest of the area   |
 | is dark so you may end up going along the wrong path to actually reach    |
 | the crystal you're trying to get to. Once you reach a crystal press the   |
 | secondary attack button to dig down into it and then rapidly tap it to    |
 | dig out the treasure and the crystal. Picking the crystal up will         |
 | increase your timer. Then just go off and do the same for the other two   |
 | crystals. There are also bonus gems hidden around the place for you to    |
 | find just like the other zones but remember that as soon as you get the   |
 | third crystal you exit the area so try to get all three bonus gems before |
 | that.                                                                     |
 |                                                                           |
 | Your reward is that of present with [Hat 3/3 - Life Preserver Hat] along  |
 | with the SWAP Zone being unlocked.                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go right from the SWAP Zone and down past a few Chompies to a large gate with a
couple of Screwballs in front of it.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020110]      Woodburrow Landing (Water)      [020110] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

To finish off the level start killing the Greeble Screwballs and the Chompy
Pods next to them, a few more Greebles and Screwballs will arrive once you've
killed off the existing ones so take care of them to finish the level.

   ,--------------------------------------,
  | [020111]      Woodburrow      [020111] |
   '--------------------------------------'

And now for the game's hub level. Woodburrow is where you'll be returning to
after every level and it'll continue to improve and change each time. This
first time through there's a few things to pick up, like if you go backwards
from where you start up the path towards the Town Gates you opened you'll find
a present with [Puma Hat] inside.

You can also head to the right side of the level through the Yard with the
bouncy punk mushrooms and, if it's between 3pm and 6pm? there's a rainbow
bridge active to reach a small island filled with coins, a [Treasure Chest] and
a [Story Scroll].

The main task to do though is to talk to the HipBros over by the blue pod to
the right of the Enchanted Pool in the centre of Woodburrow. After talking to
Gorm and Tuk you'll be tasked to fix up the Power Pod, walk up to it and press
the Interact button before spinning the pieces into place. Talk to Gorm again
to be shown how to use the Power Pod, you can now purchase upgrades for your
Skylander, if it's a swappable Skylander you will first need to choose whether
you want to upgrade the Top half or the Bottom half.

After exiting the Power Pod Tuk will create some Training Dummies for you to
practice your attacks on. Hit one once to complete the task, then it's time to
get going. You can use the glowing "magic circle" next to the dummies in order
to quickly jump across the level to the docks where Flynn can be found. Talk to
him to get the option to go to the next level, Cascade Glade.

  | [020201]      Luau Lagoon (Air)      [020201] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

Walk forwards and jump up the small rise in the path where you'll be introduced
to Gobblepods. These are friendly plants who will help by attacking enemies for
you if they get too close.

To the right of the Gobblepod is a pair of binoculars, if you go up to it and
press the Interact button you can look through the Seeker Scope to find a bit
of extra treasure. Move the view left and right looking for the glowing dot,
you'll also hear the beeping sound get more intense as you align with it, zoom
in by pushing forwards to pop the treasure out of the Gobblepod that you can
see. You will be able to pick up that extra bit of treasure once you get to the
point in the level that you're looking at.

At the end of the path ahead is a pair of blocks that you can push. First push
the right one to the left side then jump up onto it from the wooden section and
then up to the left. If you keep going left you'll find [Treasure Chest 1/4].
Return to the blocks and if you can't manage to jump to the raised platform to
the north try pushing the two blocks more central. Once you've got up there
you'll find a locked gate with a puzzle to solve.

This is a Spark Lock. All you need to do is move each of the two cubes so that
they are on the same square, you can also pick up some optional lightning bolts
to get bonus coins when you solve it. The slightly raised round circles control
the spring platforms of the same colour, so standing on the purple button at
the bottom will lower the three purple octagons next to it. This allows you to
move over them and get to things beyond them. Take "Shock", the blue cube, to
the right over the purple platforms and then upwards through the blue lightning
bolt, then left onto the green button to lower the green platform to the left.
With that Shock is stuck and cannot get any further so switch to the other
cube, the green "Bolt", and take him left over the blue button, further left
over the blue platforms then down through the green lightning bolt and to the
right towards the orange button. This will clear the way so that you can move
either of the two cubes to bump into the other one and finish the puzzle. If
you find yourself stepping on a button and a platform raises that you want
lowered just step off and then back on to the button to press it again.

A new type of enemy is beyond the gate, the Evilized Greeble. This is a lot
like the Greeble you've seen before but instead of slamming a mace down they
swing a sword in front of them. Just make sure not to stand in front of them
when they're pulling the sword back to start the swing and you should be fine.
On the left side of the area is a Fire Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Scorched Earth (Fire)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This is very much a platforming section, you have to jump between round   |
 | platforms that move to get to the other end. First walk forwards and jump |
 | onto the initial round platform, then left over a periodic flame burst -  |
 | jump when it's not flaming - to a second round platform. Go forwards onto |
 | another and then you're looking at two rows of round platforms moving     |
 | left. Jump onto one of the nearest row and then straight onto the second  |
 | row before jumping to the stationary platform on the left ahead. Two more |
 | platforms will take you to a set of three twos of moving platforms, do    |
 | the same and jump your way to the end of the zone. Your reward is inside  |
 | the present, it's [Legendary Treasure 1/1] "Cascade Bust".                |
 |                                                                           |
 | To leave the zone jump up the stepped platforms on the left to reach the  |
 | spot with an arrow pointing at it. It'll take you back near the start of  |
 | the zone, walk towards the screen to get the rest of the way out.         |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Follow the path forwards and up to a gillman, Snagglescale, who's with Flynn
and Tessa. Before you smash through the bamboo fence further on, go to the left
side and jump up the ledge in the gap. Keep going left over the wooden bridge
and jump over the gaps to make your way up to [Soul Gem 1/3 - Countdown]. Once
you've got it turn around and go back the way you came, then smash through the
bamboo fence near Flynn and Tessa, dropping down the ledge is a one way thing
as it's too high to jump back up, so make sure you're ready.

Down there you'll meet your first Greeble Blunderbuss. A little different to
the Screwballs that you met in the last level, instead of firing into the air
they will fire straight along the ground at you, this means you will have to
watch out for the bullets when you're moving around, you can jump over them
fairly easily. After defeating the first two another pair will appear just up
the small ledge as well as a few Chompies. With all of them dead too the
monster gate behind them will open up.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [020202]      Totem Trail (Air)      [020202] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

Here's where the treasure you saw through the Seeker Scope is, take the
righthand path to get to it and if you keep going along that path you will
reach a blue glowing cave in the rocks.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [020203]      Dusty Cavern (Air)      [020203] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

There is nothing to this cave, just a few jumps up the steps to reach [Seed
Packets 1/5]. Head back out once you've got it.

Now take the left path up towards another Gopplepod, you can just let it eat
the Evilized Greeble for you. Go to the right along the branch to a block
puzzle. Push the right block forwards once and then the left one to the right
four times. Push that first block right once and then forwards three times to
get it into position. Jump up onto the second block to get up to where there's
a Blunderbuss standing on a small tree stump. Kill it and then jump left over
the block you pushed to reach [Story Scroll].

To the right is a magic circle which you can use like in Woodburrow, stand on
it and Interact before rapidly tapping the button it asks you to to get thrown
to the next part of the level (no going back).

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020204]      Gobblepod Sanctuary (Life)      [020204] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Walk past Pollywog and keep to the left side, if you jump up the ledge there
you can turn around and head back to the left and reach [Treasure Chest 2/4].
Get back down to the path and head into some Evilized Greebles that are caging
Gobblepods, if you smash the cages the Gobblepods will help by eating some
Greebles. Once you've killed the Blunderbusses as well the monster gate will
open.

Go through the gate and you'll encounter another brand new feature, a
Checkpoint. This is a point in the level at which your progress is saved, if
you leave the level now you can re-enter the level at this exact point if you
choose to. Checkpoints are usually accompanied by the mid-level Power Pods
where you can buy upgrades, there's one just ahead of you.

To your right though is a Bounce Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Sunny Heights (Bounce)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Bounce Swap Zones are made up of jumping between platforms, your task is  |
 | to get to the far end of the platforms and land on the large Kaos balloon |
 | to pop it. Use your shadow to guide where you're coming down and the      |
 | double jump that you can use in here to go higher or further. Each of the |
 | three sections has a bonus gem to collect as usual, the first one is up   |
 | on a platform a little higher just before the Kaos balloon. The second    |
 | one is to the left up high towards the start of the second section, and   |
 | the third is in a similar position on the third.                          |
 |                                                                           |
 | Once you make to the third balloon without falling off you unlock the     |
 | zone in the menu and earn yourself [Hat 1/3 - The Outsider].              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

To the left is a cave behind some crates.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020205]      Tourist Trap (Life)      [020205] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

First walk forwards and go up the left side, jump onto the moving platform as
it swings towards you and grab [Seed Packets 2/5] before jumping back onto it
again and going back towards the entrance, don't leave though. Instead go to
the right of the first step and down onto a platform rising and falling. Jump
along the series of small platforms down here and out the cave exit at the
other end. Jump the gap in the bridge to reach [Soul Gem 2/3 - Slobber Tooth].
Go back into the cave and reverse your path along the platforms to get back out
the entrance again.

With all that done head forwards up the slope past the Power Pod to meet your
first large enemy, the Greeble Ironclad. These are melee enemies that have an
invulnerability shield around them when you can see the purple shield icons.
That means nothing can hurt it until it takes it down, to get it to do that you
need to get close so that he raises his fist, quickly move out of the way as
he'll then start punching forwards and move a little. This is the point at
which the shield drops and you only have a few seconds before he puts it back
up so get attacking, attacks that stun can delay the shield being put back up a
bit.

After the first Ironclad is down a few Evilized Greebles will run up to attack
you as well as a second Ironclad. Try to take down the two Greebles first as
you can generally ignore the Ironclad so long as you don't stand still too
long. Along the wooden path to the right there's a dual element Tech and Earth
gate. Remember that if you don't have swappers of an element you can always use
co-op mode and use two Skylanders.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Boulder Gully (Earth)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Not a massive puzzle, push one of the blocks to the lower left corner and |
 | the other to the lower right corner. You can jump up onto each of them    |
 | from the raised section at the start of the area to grab the floating     |
 | gears on each side. Once you've got them go to the very back of the cave  |
 | and towards the two arrows, as you approach them the gears you're         |
 | carrying should automatically snap into place. Pull the lever to open the |
 | gate and find the present with a [Winged Sapphire] inside.                |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

A little further down the path past where you fought the Ironclads is a Sneak
Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Area Fifty Tree (Sneak)                                                   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Welcome to the first Sneak Swap Zone. In here you'll be trying to get to  |
 | the other end of the fortress without getting detected by the red camera  |
 | lights (and without dying to the laser beams). Movement in here is        |
 | restricted to slowly walking around and when you go into stealth you      |
 | can't move so you'll have to sit in stealth while a camera passes by      |
 | before you can move along. If you are spotted by a camera you have a      |
 | chance to quickly go into stealth, if you stay visible too long you'll    |
 | get thrown out and have to start the zone again. In co-op the second      |
 | player can, every now and then, cause all of the cameras to switch off    |
 | for a few seconds which can be helpful in speeding up your progress.      |
 |                                                                           |
 | Go down the slope to your right over the two white circles, these will    |
 | fire laser beams out of them so try not to cross them when they're doing  |
 | so. Keep on going down towards the red dashed path with a red circle of   |
 | light moving from side to side, this is a camera, if you are visible when |
 | it passes over you it will detect you so when the light gets near go into |
 | stealth mode and wait for it to pass by. If you want the bonus gem then   |
 | go to the left down past some more lasers to get it, otherwise go to the  |
 | right and open the door.                                                  |
 |                                                                           |
 | The next bonus gem is to the right of the next track, you'll need to move |
 | quickly over the four laser beams to get it. Go along to the left through |
 | another camera and then off the left side you'll find another cog to      |
 | rotate to open up the door, go back along the path and cross the beams to |
 | get through the door.                                                     |
 |                                                                           |
 | The last bonus gem is over in the far left corner, watch out for the      |
 | second camera that passes over it. Directly ahead is the target for the   |
 | zone, a red button on a pedestal, go over the laser beams and press it.   |
 | the reward is [Hat 2/3 - Rain Hat].                                       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Head into the cave.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020206]      Honeybadger Hollow (Life)      [020206] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Take the left side of the path going up the edge before heading right at the
top. If you jump onto the rising platforms here you'll be able to reach
[Treasure Chest 3/4]. Get back down off those rising platforms to the gapped
set of platforms heading to the right out of the cave.

Before solving the puzzle in the gate you should jump down through the gap
towards the screen where you'll pick up [Seed Packets 3/5]. You should be able
to jump back up but if you're having trouble just jump down further and head
back through the cave again.

The Spark Lock "Going Up!" requires you to send Shock to the right onto a
square pink platform on a pole, this will move to the right close to a blue
button to stand on. Stand on it and then ride the pink square back to the left.
Switch to Bolt to jump on the blue platform that just arrived next to him and
press an orange button at the other end. Move onto the orange hexagons and
switch to Shock. You can now either just finish the lock or continue on to get
the bolts, if you want the bolts move Shock down onto the orange button and
then jump on the blue platform to ride over to the blue lightning. Switch to
Bolt, grab the green lightning and then jump down to the orange button, switch
back to Shock one last time to ride the platform to meet Bolt.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020207]      Overlook Heights (Life)      [020207] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Wander up the path under a Blunderbuss towards a Greeble. Kill it and then go
up the slope on the left to reach the Blunderbuss to attack it. If you continue
towards the screen along this path you'll find [Treasure Chest 4/4] hidden a
little by the shrubbery. On the right side of the path if you walk towards the
screen you'll find [Seed Packets 4/5]. And there's a Speed Swap Zone too.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Woodlands Speedstacle (Speed)                                             |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Speed zones are all about speeding along past obstacles trying to get to  |
 | the other end in time. Here you'll want to tap the boost button as often  |
 | as you can, although obviously you'll want to do it without an obstacle   |
 | directly in your way. Move left and right to avoid the spikes and other   |
 | objects, there are sometimes ramps to go over the blocks on the floor.    |
 | Again this is separated into three sections with no real difference       |
 | between them, there's a bonus gem in each section though.                 |
 |                                                                           |
 | The reward for this is [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Plants vs Cakes].         |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

For the next block pushing puzzle just past Barbfin all you need to do is push
it down twice and right twice, then jump onto the block and walk along the
upper section. Push the far block up here off to the left and then the
remaining block up once and then left on top of the one you just pushed off.
That should give you enough to jump across to the magic circle.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020208]      Bamboo Bridge (Magic)      [020208] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

There's an Evilized Greeble and a couple of Ironclads down here, defeat them
and head into the cave at the end.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020209]      Spelunk Shallow (Magic)      [020209] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Jump onto the raising platforms ahead and over to where some Chompies will
attack you. Kill them and the Blunderbuss up behind them before going to the
left onto a moving platform, wait for it to reach as far left as it goes before
jumping onto a second moving platform, from there onto solid ground with a
couple of Blunderbusses and some Evilized Greebles. Again head to the left once
you've killed them and onto a platform that's going up and down, ride it up and
jump to a second one behind it.

At the top go to the right over another moving platform and then down to the
right along the platforms, kill another couple of Greebles before finally
reaching [Seed Packets 5/5]. If you jump off to the right of here you're back
near where the first enemies of the cave were. Go up the platforms on your
right to the exit.

Time for an Undead zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Spooky Sidetrack (Undead)                                                 |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Skully in here wants you to retrieve his hat from an Evilized Greeble. Go |
 | up the ramp and jump up the steps to get to a large open fighting area.   |
 | First up is a wave of four Evilized Greebles, kill them and three more    |
 | will appear along with two Blunderbusses. After all of them are gone the  |
 | behatted Greeble on the platform will jump down to fight you, he's not    |
 | really any different to the other Evilized Greebles so if you've taken    |
 | care of those easily he won't be a problem. Pick up the Hat he leaves     |
 | behind. If you want to there's a Seeker Scope up on the left that you can |
 | look through, the bonus treasure is with the Gobblepod to the left of the |
 | gate.                                                                     |
 |                                                                           |
 | Head back through the zone with the hat to Skully to get your reward. Not |
 | quite the same one as you rescued but a [Hat 3/3 - Glittering Tiara]      |
 | nonetheless.                                                              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Carry on along the path past a couple of Evilized Greebles to a large block
puzzle area. Push the first block forwards and then the block next to it to the
right once. Push the next block on the left up twice and then block on the
right up once and then right three times. You can go past it to get to some
bonus treasure from a Seeker Scope if you want. Otherwise push the left block
back down once and then the block to its left to the left twice so you can get
behind to a Giant chest. There's also [Soul Gem 3/3 - Rattle Shake] off to the
left side.

Jump back up and solve the Spark Lock puzzle on the gate, "Shocking
Jailbreak!". First switch to the green cube Bolt, take him over to the red
sliding platforms and press the orange button. Switch to Shock and stand on the
lowered orange platform, switch back to Bolt and step off and then back onto
the orange button. As Shock go right onto the purple button and switch back to
Bolt again. Press the orange button once again and then make your way over the
red sliding platforms to the lowered orange platform. Switch to Shock and jump
off the edge of the raised section to get down to the orange button and the
blue lightning bolt. Back to Bolt again to grab the green bolt and then jump
down off the raised section. Switch to Shock one last time and make your way
over to Bolt to finish the puzzle.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020210]      Overflow Grotto (Magic)      [020210] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

The last area of the level. There's a couple of Blunderbusses and a Ironclad to
defeat here, if you smash the cages off the Gopplepods you can try to lure the
Ironclad onto one (up to the left of the gate you can find the Seeker Scope
treasure). After those are gone a few Chompies will appear followed by some
Evilized Greebles, Ironclads and Blunderbusses. Keep luring the larger enemies
into the Gopplepods as you attack the Blunderbusses. And that is that, go
through the gate to rescue the Chieftess.

   ,--------------------------------------,
  | [020211]      Woodburrow      [020211] |
   '--------------------------------------'

Back in Woodburrow once again, go talk to Tuk who is now hanging around by his
shop up the ramp to the left side of the pool. He wants you to help open Tuk's
Emporium, to do that you'll have to go pick up bits of debris from around the
area. First up is a pile of wood over to the left, once you've picked it up go
back to Tuk and then tap it into place. The second set is down by the top end
of the pool and the last is on the left side of the pool. For rebuilding his
shop you get a [Winged Sapphire]. Cool. The availability of items in the shop
is down to your Portal Master rank, but as the game hasn't told you what that
is just yet there's not much you can buy at the moment.

After that it's time to pay the Chieftess a visit in the Great Hollow up the
stairs behind the pool. As you go in you'll see the two others that you
rescued, the Gillman Councillor on the right has a Spark Lock that you can play
to get some treasure, the puzzles are just repeats of the ones you get in the
levels. ANd on the left is the Yeti Councillor who has an elemental chest that
requires a specific element to unlock, once it's unlocked you can switch to any
Skylander to actually open it.

Carry on over the bridge to the Chieftess to talk to her. Once you're done with
that go over to Tessa and Flynn by the docks to get the option to go to
Mudwater Hollow, the next level.

  | [020301]      Woodbridge Way (Air)      [020301] |
   '------------------------------------------------'

Go past Tessa up the tree branch bridge to a new enemy, a Grumblebum Thrasher.
These are essentially just slightly larger versions of Evilized Greebles, they
run up to you and swing their mace. Simple. On the left side of the path is a
glowing [Floaty Life Preserver 1/6]. Carry on straight forwards and you'll spot
a [Story Scroll] at the corner where the path goes right, kill the Chompies and
the two Thrashers that attack to get to it.

   ,---------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020302]      Froghollow Fishin' Pond (Air)      [020302] |
   '---------------------------------------------------------'

Follow the curve of the path down to the right. where a gillman named
Snagglescale is waiting on a wooden jetty. He wants you to do some fishing to
get rid of some piranhas, go over to the fishing pole over to the right and
grab hold of it. The fishing mini-game requires you to move the fishing bobber
towards one of the fish, once it's close enough the fish will bite and you have
to rapidly tap the Attack 1 button to reel it in, it is worth noting that you
can steer while pulling a fish in and slow the pull by tapping less rapidly.
The whirlpools will slow you down so try to avoid going directly over them, try
to position the bobber so that the fish swim into it rather than trying to
constantly chase them around.

Before you cross the bridge that Snagglescale forms head to the right of where
the fishing pole is and jump over to a [Treasure Chest 1/6]. ANd to the left of
where Snagglescale was is a path to a Rocket Swap Zone.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This one is filled with electrified orbs, the electricity between each    |
 | pair of them is damaging so look for safe paths around them. The bonus    |
 | gem layout is a little different in that there are two in the final       |
 | section.                                                                  |

 | The reward for getting to the end is [Hat 1/2 - Boater Hat].              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

You can cross over the water now, time to meet the first Spell Punk of the game
the Life Spell Punk. Just like in the previous games a Life Spell Punk will
heal other nearby enemies, that means if you want an easier time you'll try to
get rid of the Spell Punk first. It doesn't seem to do any damage to you itself
so the only thing to watch out for is the other enemies.

Once you've killed it and the three Thrashers that appear to help to go to the
right into a building instead of the through the monster gate that just opened.

   ,---------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020303]      Snagglescale's Bungalow (Air)      [020303] |
   '---------------------------------------------------------'

In here there's a Spark Lock to solve, "My Biggest Fan". This one has slippery
surfaces and fans to turn on and off. First take Shock down onto the ice so
that it bounces over to the orange button. That lowers the orange platform so
Bolt can press the green button behind it. The green fan in the middle of the
slippery section turns on, switch back to Shock and slide down so that it
pushes you towards the green lightning bolt, go left and press the purple
button to set Bolt free. Still as Shock head onto the red platform to slide
over to the top right section, wait on the normal platforms just between the
two entrances to the slippery surface. Switch to Bolt and use the red platform
to reach where Shock is. Now use the slippery surface to get past Shock without
touching him, use the red platform on the left to reach the green lightning
bolt and then turn around and return to the upper section. Take Shock down on
the right red platform to get his blue lightning bolt before returning to meet
up with Bolt.

After that the [Treasure Chest 2/6] unlocks to give you your coins.

Head back out and go through the monster gate you opened before.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [020304]      Billy's Bend (Air)      [020304] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

Walk along the bend towards a trio of Thrashers before reaching a locked gate
and a block puzzle. Head into the house on the right first.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020305]      Billy's Bend Storehouse      [020305] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Not really any reason to go in here but it's part of the objective to find all
the areas. There is a Giant Chest at the back though.

Now for the block puzzle outside. First push the middle block to the right once
and then the block on the edge off the edge. Return the first block to its
original position and then push it over the top of the block you pushed off.
The last block needs to be pushed forwards and then to the right before pushing
it over the other two and into a small dip on the other side, use it to jump up
to the [Treasure Chest 3/6]. Grab the key and unlock the gate.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020306]      Snagglescale Swamp (Air)      [020306] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Another new enemy awaits on the other side, Grumblebum Rockshooter. These are a
stationary enemy that fires rockets at you. Pretty much Blunderbusses except
that when defeated they fire one final blast straight up into the air where
they're sitting, so if you're melee attacking them make sure to move away once
you defeat one. There's two of them along with a Thrasher and a Chompy Pod,
then another pair of Thrashers up to the left of the second Rockshooter. If you
follow that wooden bridge along to the left you'll reach a Life gate, don't go
on Snagglescale's boat until you've been in there (if you want to go in there
that is).

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 | This area is just a fishing mini-game. Gilly Greg wants you to catch a    |
 | fish that has eaten some treasure, go down the path to the water where    |
 | the fishing pole is waiting. You need to catch four fish, the problem is  |
 | that there are electric eels in the way this time, you need to keep the   |
 | bobber away from them otherwise it'll get shocked and if you've got a     |
 | fish hooked it'll get away. Good use of brief pauses and directing the    |
 | bobber while reeling it back in should help you avoid the eels.           |
 |                                                                           |
 | The reward is a [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - Luminous Lure].                 |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Talk to Snagglescale and then jump on the boat to start the trip down river.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020307]      Quiet Time Shallows (Air)      [020307] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

To steer the boat you just move to the side that you want the boat to go, the
further in that direction you move the sharper the turn will be. Steer through
the gaps in the mines and try not to hit anything.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [020308]      Lazy Lock Isles (Fire)      [020308] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Once you're done with the first river section go up the left path past a few
Rockshooters to make it up to the building that Snagglescale mentioned.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020309]      Lazy Lock Gatehouse (Fire)      [020309] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Salvage Steve in here directs you towards the fishing pole. Just one fish to
catch in here and some eels to avoid as you do so.

Go back down the way you came and kill the little Chompies that have appeared.
Before putting the gear in place go down the path to the left side of it,
you'll have to smash through a bit of debris to open it up. Jump the gaps and
kill the Rockshooters to reach the [Floaty Life Preserver 2/6]. Put the gear in
place and spin the gate down, jump back onto the boat to get going.

   ,--------------------------------------------,
  | [020310]      Lazy Lock (Fire)      [020310] |

Nothing to this section, just wait for the boat to go up.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020312]      Broken Bog Bay (Fire)      [020312] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Another missing gear, go up to the right to where there's a Life Spell Punk, a
couple of Thrashers and a Rockshooter to take care of. If you go along the path
to the right you'll reach a Magic gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Mysterious Magical Maze (Magic)                                           |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Teleport into the sidescrolling section and then start heading to the     |
 | right. Over the first jump there's a few Thrashers to defeat but beyond   |
 | that it's fairly straightforward jumping over gaps and then onto some     |
 | platforms that are rising and falling. After those is a teleport upwards  |
 | onto a moving platform, wait for it to go to the left where it'll take    |
 | you to a few more Thrashers and a Life Spell Punk helping them. After     |
 | them it's just a little further to the end up some moving platforms.      |
 |                                                                           |
 | The reward is [Legendary Treasure 2/2 - Bubble Chest].                    |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Take the left path now but don't go into the glowing doorway, instead smash
through the debris to the right of it and walk along the path behind there. Go
up past some Rockshooters and a few Chompies to a building at the top.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020313]      Don's Baitshop (Fire)      [020313] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Collect all of the bouncing fish to get a small pile of gold, then turn around
and go back outside again.

To the left is a block puzzle. Push the left block forwards once and then walk
around the back to push the end block in twice so you can reach [Soul Gem 1/3 -
Zoo Lou]. With that collected head back and go through the glowing door in the
wall you passed by earlier.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020314]      Big Gill Water Mill (Fire)      [020314] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Go left past the block and into the corner where there's [Treasure Chest 4/6]
hiding behind some barrels. Now push the block left once and then forwards into
the gap. Jump up over it to the left, push the block at the top forwards into a
small dip and jump up and push the block above it left once to let the giant
gear turn properly. Go right over the gapped platforms and ride a turning gear
up to the next layer.

Go left at the top to a small block puzzle. You can get the blocks stuck in
more difficult positions than necessary but even with the blocks up against
opposite walls you should be able to make the jump from one of them onto the
blocks to the left. The easiest way is to push the near block left twice and
then back against the wall at the top, then the other block left once and then
against the wall too.

Grab the gear but don't go through the door just yet, instead take a look at
the giant turning gear to the left, if you jump onto it and make your way to
the top corner by jumping over the teeth you'll find a gap where you can go to
reach [Floaty Life Preserver 3/6]. Now you can leave.

Jump down and put the gear into place before spinning the lock door open, jump
onto the boat to get moving again.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020315]      Broken Bog Bay Lock (Fire)      [020315] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Another lock to wait for.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [020316]      Rumblin' Rapids (Fire)      [020316] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

And some more mines to dodge around.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020317]      Muddy Marsh Village (Tech)      [020317] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

And a checkpoint too. On your left is a Power Pod to upgrade if you want, if
you go behind it to the left you can get behind the buildings and find
[Treasure Chest 5/6]. Now head to the right side of the docks, go over a few
gaps to where [Floaty Life Preserver [4/6] is. Go back to the village and fight
the enemies attacking it, there's a few Thrashers and a couple of Rockshooters
by the locked magic circle.

Do not take the magic circle just yet, there's still more to do in the village.
Go into the inn to the right of the circle first.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020318]      Jug Jamboree Inn (Tech)      [020318] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

If you go up the ramp at the back of the inn and smash the barrels, crates and
tyres piled up you can find a secret exit.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020319]      Muddy Marsh Secret (Tech)      [020319] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Back here is [Soul Gem 2/3 - Free Ranger]. And that's it, go back through the
inn to the village again.

   ,----------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020320]      Saltytooth's Scrap Shop (Tech)      [020320] |
   '----------------------------------------------------------'

North-west of the magic circle is another building you can enter, this one has
a Spark Lock chest to solve, "Free Me". First take Shock up along the slippery
surface to press the red button. Switch to Bolt and move past the first dropped
blockage to where the platforms have raised up. Switch back to Shock and slide
back and then back again to press the button a second time. Move Bolt past it
and then have Shock press the button once again. Now take Shock and move him
into the gap between the left and middle red platforms, avoiding Bolt. Switch
to Bolt and go and press the red button while picking up the green lightning
bolt. Switch back and forth pressing the button to get Shock over to the blue
lightning bolt and back again so that you can bump into each other and open
[Treasure Chest 6/6].

Leave the building and take a look at the green boghog lying on the ground to
the north, if you bounce on it five times it'll dig into the ground and give
you [Floaty Life Preserver 5/6]. Now to the north is a Water and Undead Dual
Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This area is a fighting arena, kill off the Thrashers that appear and     |
 | then approach one of the buttons, watch the fish in the bubble behind and |
 | if he nods his head pull that lever to open up the gate, if he shakes it  |
 | no then go to a different lever. Behind the gate you'll find a [Winged    |
 | Sapphire] in a present.                                                   |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

And that's it for around here, go and use the magic circle in the middle of the
village to get to the next part.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020321]      Chompy Chew Shortcut (Magic)      [020321] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

Go down the path to the right and you'll soon come across a Spin Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Marbled Gardens (Spin)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Spin Zones make use of pinball bumpers around the edge to make your       |
 | spinning a bit more difficult with lots of bouncing around all over the   |
 | place. The red and white bumpers will knock you back, you cannot destroy  |
 | these. The black squares take just one hit to destroy, the barrels take   |
 | several or just one super spin. Your aim is to get to the middle of the   |
 | circle, on the third area that'll be a large Kaos statue but for the      |
 | first two it's just a teleport to the next area. In each area there is a  |
 | bonus gem to pick up but remember that is not really necessary in the     |
 | story mode versions of these zones.                                       |
 |                                                                           |
 | Try to guide your spinning Skylander around as best you can to hit the    |
 | black squares and barrels that are blocking your way to the middle but    |

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Carry on down the path past a line of Chompies to a circular area with a new
enemy to introduce, the Evilized Boghog. Quickly get out of its way as it'll
charge straight at you, the time to attack is when it's stunned after hitting a
wall after charging. Keep on doing that until the evil is gone. Head out of the
tree stump and onto a wooden platform. Go to the right side of it and jump off
the edge onto a floating tyre. Jump along the tyres to another wooden platform
with some Thrashers and a couple of Rockshooters. Defeat them and head up to
the left to a Chompy Pod and then [Soul Gem 3/3 - Bumble Blast].

Jump down off the platform to the layer below and head towards the screen,
you'll find yourself just in front of where you jumped onto the tyres. Take the
left path.

Keep on going left past a trio of Rockshooters and a Chompy Pod along some more
tyres to a magic circle.

   '--------------------------------------------------------'

As soon as you arrive you'll be attacked by two Evilized Boghogs, they should
be pretty much in tune with each other and charge at the same time so you will
have plenty of time between charges to attack one or the other. Go up the steps
and you'll spot a Teleport Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Another new type to introduce, the Teleport Swap Zone is a simple         |
 | concept. Point your Skylander in a direction and press the teleport       |
 | button to teleport to a platform there. What comes between you and the    |
 | pyramid shaped Magic Runes are things like furnaces, blocking platforms   |
 | and falling platforms. If you see a white light filling up a circle       |
 | around a platform that means that the platform will drop once it fills,   |
 | so try not to teleport onto a platform that's just about to disappear.    |
 | Don't worry if the Magic Rune is on a disappearing platform, it'll        |
 | quickly reappear somewhere else. The furnaces will appear in the second   |
 | part, they're black circles that turn to fire, they're safe to quickly    |
 | cross over when it's a black circle but you will take damage if it's on   |
 | fire. There's no need to wait on a platform for very long, you can        |
 | instantly press the teleport button again to move in whatever direction   |
 | you're pointed at so if you do have to go through a furnace make sure to  |
 | do it as quickly as possible.                                             |
 |                                                                           |
 | Each of the three sections has three Magic Runes to grab, once you've got |
 | them all you'll go into a bonus mode where you need to grab each bit of   |
 | treasure, what this also serves to do is increase the size of the area    |
 | you're teleporting around as the size it becomes is what the next section |
 | will be like. There's also one bonus gem flying around during each        |
 | section, make sure to grab it before picking up the third Magic Rune.     |
 | Once you've got the ninth one you'll exit and get the [Bonus Mission Map  |
 | - Master Chef] reward.                                                    |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Time to take out the crystals, go up the slope towards the Flashfin and head to
the right to the first of the pink glowing crystals, to destroy you just have
to attack it. The first one's simple, no enemies to hinder you. Use the magic
circle a bit further along to get to the next bit.

Right as you arrive go to the right to pick up the last of [Floaty Life
Preserver 6/6] then head left to attack a few Thrashers and Chompies coming out
of the Chompy Pod. Once you've got rid of them destroy the crystal they're
hanging out next to. The third crystal is nearby, take out the Thrashers,
Rockshooters, a Life Spell Punk and a Chompy Pod that are defending it first
though.

And the last one is along to the left, yet more enemies will appear to defend
it. That's a Rockshooter over in the left corner and then another to the right,
kill all the Thrashers and the Chompy Pod and finally destroy the fourth
crystal to finish the level.

Another section of Woodburrow has now opened up, go talk to the Chieftess by
the floating rune symbols near the docks. Perform the action as she requests,
go up the steps and talk to Eon. This opens up the Portal Master rank system
and also lets you play the Bonus Mission Maps that you've been collecting. What
can you do with your Portal Master rank? Well for now the only thing is that it
unlocks items in Tuk's Emporium but a bit later it'll help with using Legendary
Treasures too.

You can also now climb the Mushroom Stairway, it's the reddish brown things
sticking out of the tree to the right of the airdocks, partway up there's [Soul
Gem - Hoot Loop] to pick up, and if you climb to the top you can reach a
[Winged Sapphire] and some fireworks as well as a magic circle jump down into
the pool. As well as a load of coins there's a present in this side-scrolling
section that contains [Hat - Turkey Hat]. To leave jump on the final bounce pad
and into the light above it.

Once you're done go talk to Tessa to get on to Rampant Ruins.

   '-------------------------------------------------'

Down the slope to an Ent called Willowbark who'll introduce the level a bit,
directly ahead you can use the Seeker Scope for a bit of extra treasure but
only bother if you're able to get into a dual Magic and Fire gate. The treasure
is straight ahead with the robotic enemy that looks to be holding a cannon.

A little further down the slope to the right and you'll meet a new Chompy
Rustbud. They're pretty much just the same as the Chompies you've been fighting
before, they don't do anything any different. At the bend if you go behind the
tombstones you'll see a floating green [Grave Monkey Totem 1/5] on the tree
stump. Carry on down to the left over some spike traps to another enemy, the
Arkeyan Barrelbot. This enemy is similar to the Greeble Blunderbuss from
previous levels, it'll stand still and fire a shot along the ground towards you
occasionally. Not much different really.

To the right is a dual Magic and Fire Gate that you may have spotted through
the Seeker Scope.

 | Go up the stepped platforms jumping over the volcano bursts when they     |
 | stop flaming, there's a bit of treasure off the side at the top and a     |
 | bounce pad to get back up. Watch out for the Barrelbot that's firing at   |
 | you the whole time in here from the platform in the middle. The next bit  |
 | of platforming involves some platforms moving from side to side, just     |
 | watch for when they start moving to adjust your jump.                     |

 | Round the corner is a larger moving platform, it should time just right   |
 | with the fire bursts so you don't get hit. Go up the steps and over one   |

 | the present hidden within and claim your [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - The    |
 | Monkey's Paw]. This is also where the Seeker Scope bonus treasure is      |
 | found. Use the teleporter next to you to get back to the start of the     |

The stone bridge you're about to cross will collapse after you so make sure
you've done everything you want to in this section as you can't go back.

On the left straight away there's a path off to a chest with a Spark Lock on
it, "Slide and Shuffle". Shock is initially stuck so switch to Bolt and go down
to the pink platform to ride it around to the pink button at the top, that'll
reset them into their original position. Step on the moving arrow square to be
pushed down onto the green button. With Shock free switch back to him and go
press the orange button. Switch back to Bolt and cross over the lowered
platform to get back to the start, go over to the green lightning bolt to pick
it up. Move into position next to the orange button and then switch back to
Shock and ride the pink platforms around to stand on the lowered orange
platform. Use Bolt to press the orange button (you may need to have Shock press
the green button again to lower the platforms) to raise Shock up to be able to
reach the blue lightning bolt. Grab it and if you need to go and drop onto the
green button again to free Bolt. Now either go down over the orange platform
with Shock or just have Bolt ride the pink platforms around. That's [Treasure
Chest 1/5].

Go back out to the main path and across the wooden bridge to an area with a
nice friendly looking bat floating about. Time for the Evilized Sugarbat debut!
These act a whole lot like the Evilized Boghogs, they charge towards you and
bash themselves into a wall when they miss. They'll be stunned for a few
seconds so that's your time to attack. At first it's just one by itself but
once that one's defeated a pair of them will appear and take you on at the same
time.

Go through the monster gate once they've all been saved to speak to Willowbark
once again. Drop down into the next section to fight another load of Sugarbats.
Once again it'll start you out with a single Sugarbat to fight before throwing
in a few Chompies and then the remaining three Sugarbats (including a larger
one but it's not really any different to the others).

  | [020403]      Orangutan Tower      [020403] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

Immediately to the right as you leave the Sugarbat arena is a [Treasure Chest
2/5] before you head up the slope towards a Climb Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The main difference in this Climb Zone compared to the previous one is    |
 | that there are now platforms moving from side to side which makes it a    |
 | bit more difficult to work out exactly which of the falling objects are   |
 | going to hit it, if you're a fair distance away from it then lining       |
 | yourself up with it won't really do you much good. In the second part of  |
 | the zone you'll begin to be targeted by a rocket, this will make standing |
 | still waiting for a clear moment that little bit more difficult. It's     |
 | kind of relentless and you can only lose it once it's locked into         |
 | position, using the boost while it's still moving won't help very much.   |
 |                                                                           |
 | Your reward is [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Fishy Fishing].                   |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

There's a block puzzle ahead, first push the right block forwards and then the
left block to the left into a little dip. Push the back left block off the edge
and then the remaining block to the left and then over the block you pushed off
to form a little bridge across to the spike trap. Jump over the spikes and talk
to Forest next to them to learn of the devious gate. To make it work you just
need to time your interaction with it so that the purple hand that's swinging
around on the door is lined up with the purple dot on the left side, you need
to get it quite accurate and there's a little bit of a delay so try to press it
just before it gets there rather than exactly when it does.

The ramp behind the gate requires you to wait for the first set of spikes to go
down before rushing up it to get to the top before they catch up with you. Go
into the circular area for a fight.

Another new robot enemy, the Arkeyan Rip-rotor. These are a new form of enemy,
they'll jump into the air and start spinning causing an electric bolt to be
fired beneath them, keep out of their way while they're doing that as it's
kinda damaging and they're invulnerable while doing it. They will then become
tired and collapse onto the floor for a few seconds before starting up again,
that is your moment to strike! After defeating the first one another two will
appear, and then after those you'll get another two and a couple of Barrelbots
as well.

Once you've managed to defeat them all go to the right side of the area and
look for a thin piece of wall to walk up, this is the top of the "devious gate"
where [Grave Monkey Totem 2/5] is found. Go back along it and through the
monster gate you just opened.

   '------------------------------------------------'

Take the left path now into a Sugarbat enclosure. There are four bats in here
to take care of, try to just avoid them all at first and then take pot shots
when you can. After each one gets saved a few Chompies will appear but not very
many so shouldn't be an issue unless you don't notice them. Once all four are
gone the monster gate will open to let you reach the [Treasure Chest 3/5]
behind it.

Turn around and go down the right path this time, at the bottom you'll meet an
Arkeyan Slamshock. Yep, pretty much the same as the Greeble Ironclads, they've
got a shield on them until they try to attack you, what's different about them
is their attack. Instead of a close melee attack they will stop a much further
distance away and fire an electric ball out in front of them, this means if
you're a melee attacker you've got to quickly get in close otherwise they'll
just put their shields up again before you can even do any damage. The simplest
way of getting close is to circle around them, they'll end up firing behind you
so you can stop and immediately attack them while they're recovering. With two
of them it's a little more difficult to circle around them but get them close
together and it's fairly safe.

With the two Slamshocks out of the way you're free to go to the right where
there's a Speed Swap Zone waiting.

 | The main new issue in here is that it's very foggy, you won't be able to  |
 | see too far ahead so be prepared for quickly changing lanes. The first    |
 | two bonus gems are in the air after the food refills but the last is in   |
 | the middle of the final section on the right side between some of those   |

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

On the left side of the devious door is a drop down to [Grave Monkey Totem
3/5], jump back up and solve the door, this time it's a yellow marker going
around, hit the button at the right time to open it and reveal another
Slamshock behind it.

Checkpoint! There's a Power Pod here for you to upgrade but that's about it, go
down the slope.

 | A block puzzle ahead. Push the first block forwards once and then wait    |
 | for the spikes to drop so you can push it into place to the left once.    |
 | You can move the other two if you want but you should be able to use them |
 | as they are to get up onto the upper section at the back. Little tricky   |
 | bit now, you need to press the switch on the spikes at the right time to  |
 | get the yellow dot in the devious door to unlock, it should be timed to   |
 | be correct every two revolutions but you have to be quick getting to the  |
 | switch and pressing it.                                                   |

 | Go through the door and up the slope, push the far block to the left off  |
 | the edge and then the other block left, then up and then over the first   |
 | one. Go up to the spikes and wait for them to drop before pushing the     |
 | left block forwards off the edge, get around the other block and push it  |
 | where the last block was and then over it. Use it to get up to the top    |
 | layer and then make your way along the spikes to the left as fast as you  |
 | can.                                                                      |

 | At the end go over some final spikes (they're really quick to pop out     |
 | again) to reach the present with [Hat 1/2 - Boonie Hat]. To get out of    |
 | the area jump left over the spikes down to the first block puzzle         |
 | section, the exit should be to the left.                                  |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Before you head down the steps stand on the right side of them and jump to a
small block sticking out of the wall, from there to another and then up to the
top of a pillar where [Grave Monkey Totem 4/5] is. Jump down to fight a couple
of Slamshocks and a Rip-rotor. After you've wiped them out a trio of Barrelbots
and another Slamshock will attack, try to take out the Barrelbots one at a time
as you ignore the Slamshock. The door that you can now try to open is just the
same as the ones before but with two things spinning around. Luckily that
doesn't make much of a difference aside from needing to get the right colour
lined up there's no time limit or simultaneous unlocking needed.

Smush the Chompies and then take either the left or right path down, I'd say
the right path is a little easier to get over the spikes safely. Once at the
bottom go towards the screen into the area between the two paths, on the right
is [Treasure Chest 4/5]. Go back through the gap and then continue forwards to
a brief cutscene.

Try to avoid the rockets that are being fired at you and go over the crumbling
bridge to a Chompy ambush. Kill the Chompies and then get to the block puzzle,
push both sides forwards once and then the middle one to the left, push the
other middle one backwards once and then the two sides out, push the first
middle block forwards once and then left off the edge to make it useful to
stand on, jump onto it and then jump onto the last remaining block with [Grave
Monkey Totem 5/5] on top of it.

Go up the spike slope switching to the other side as they drop down each time.
To your left at the end is a Water Gate.

 | Use the little button thing on the first platform to lower one on your    |

 | it up again. Jump back onto it and up towards Stone Block. Push him back  |
 | towards the wall, then to the left and then to the right twice. The       |
 | bounce pad that appears will take you up to the present [Winged           |

 | Main thing to note in here is that the brown cracked looking platforms    |
 | will disintegrate after one jump on them so watch out for that. The       |

if you like.

Jump over the fallen pillars to get to a very basic block puzzle, push it
towards the gate twice and then left once. The thing is that as soon as you
push it the area will get attacked, the friendly Sugarbat has become Evilized
and there's a couple of Barrelbots too, you'll need to push the block into
place to reach the one on the ledge. Once you've killed them all open the
devious door via the switch up on the ledge.

As you go through the door immediately go down to the left where there's a
bounce pad, it'll let you get up onto the robot foot and grab [Soul Gem 1/2 -
Roller Brawl]. Jump down and talk to Willowbark again. Walk over to the purple
switch next to the light beam and press it when the rotating stonework has its
gap lined up so the beam can shine through.

Magic circle time!

Once you land go backwards to the right to find the [Story Scroll], then go
attack that Slamshock, Barrelbot and Rip-rotor that your landing missed. As you
go along the spikes to the left make sure to go into the gaps, you can even go
around the back to skip some spikes. At the left end of the spikes jump up onto
the stepped bit of the backing to go to the right and grab the [Soul Gem 2/2 -
Star Strike].

Go back to the left and take out the Barrelbot on the floot before pushing the
block forwards one space and then left into the dip. Watch out for the high up
Barrelbots as you do this, try to push right after you've dodged a shot. Jump
up onto the block and take out the left Barrelbot by pushing the block it's
standing on off the edge. Push the other block over it and off down to the
ground too. You can also press the button up here to line up the first half of
the devious door if you like.

Push the block on the ground forwards twice and then to the right three times
so it dips down ready for you to jump onto it. Kill the last of the Barrelbots
and unlock the devious door with the switch up here.

Go through the door and head towards a monster gate, the enemies will appear as
you get close. All you need to take out are the two Rip-rotors on the ground,
the two Barrelbots can be taken care of once the monster gate has opened.
However, go to the right as you go through the door and double back over some
spikes to reach the last [Treasure Chest 5/5]. Return to the fight and attack
the two Barrelbots before destroying their Slamshock pals.

A few Rip-rotors will teleport in for you to kill before the monster gates
blocking the two switches will drop. Once it's a bit more peaceful (still got
those rockets though!) hit the yellow one first to line up the rotating stone
followed by the purple one to finish off the level.

   1. Defeat Evil Glumshanks
   2. No Skylanders Defeated
   3. No Damage Taken

Not back to Woodburrow this time, instead we're in a boss fight with Evil
Glumshanks. Those spikes on the edge are the main thing to note, stand near to
one while Glumshanks trains his lights on you, as they turn red jump out of the
way of his tank that'll come charging at you. If you were positioned correctly
he'll smash into the spikes and be vulnerable to attack. Keep on repeating this
tactic until you get a cutscene showing some of the spikes disappearing.

This time he'll start by firing off a few rockets into the air, move out of the
way and then get into position to lure him into some spikes again. Same
procedure as before but he'll fire off some rockets at the start of each
recovery and the spikes will switch which ones are open and which ones are
closed.

Once the spikes change formation to just one open spike he'll also bring in
some enemies to help attack you. The Arkeyan Knuckledusters that he brings in
are very short range shots but have a wide burst. You can use Glumshanks to
attack the enemies as his tank will damage them if he runs through them, try
not to lure him into the spikes before you've got rid of the Knuckledusters as
they'll still try to attack you during his downtime making it more difficult to
get the full damage in, he'll then respawn another load of them when he does
get back up.

   '--------------------------------------'

With that boss defeated you return to Woodburrow for a break. New to Woodburrow
this time is the Message of the Day, it's on the signpost next to Rufus, you
need to read it to activate the bonus that it gives (the bonus changes
depending on the day of the week). Snagglescale has opened up the Arenas, you
can do some solo arenas but there are also co-op arenas that need two players.
No need to actually do an Arena, just exit and head off to talk to Tessa to go
to Iron Jaw Gulch.

   1. Destroy the Airships

   1. Marshal Wheellock Plushy 5
   2. Enemy Goal 50
   3. No Skylanders Defeated

   1. Areas Discovered 16
   2. Treasure Chests 3
   3. Soul Gems 3
   4. Legendary Treasures 2
   5. Hats 2
   6. Bonus Mission Map
   7. Winged Sapphire
   8. Story Scroll

Turn around and smash the little water tower on the left to get the first
[Marshal Wheellock Plushy 1/5], once you've got it head over to Marshal
Wheellock himself by the Iron Jaw Gulch sign to have a brief chat. Go through
under the sign to meet a Pirate Powderkeg, and yep they are just Blunderbusses
all dressed up. Hit the switch on the left to bring out a bridge to cross over.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [020601]      Iron Jaw Gulch (Magic)      [020601] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Kill the piratey Chompies and the Powderkeg that's shooting at you from the
side before jumping onto the bounce pad to the right of the end of the bridge,
in the air above it is [Marshal Wheellock Plushy 2/5]. If you then jump off the
far edge of the platform you can get down to some lower platforms leading
towards another Powderkeg and [Soul Gem 1/3 - Wind-Up]. Jump back up the
platforms to hit the switch back at the top.

A Fire Geargolem will appear in the middle of the next platform, these are
large enemies that set a line of fire down in front of themselves. Just circle
around it and it'll pause to blast some fire whereupon you can start attacking
perfectly safe. It doesn't even have a shield so unless you're just standing
there in one spot it shouldn't be too dangerous or difficult to destroy. A few
Chompies will appear once you've defeated it, head straight on into the
background onto a circular platform that is actually an elevator.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020602]      Cactus Pass (Magic)      [020602] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

As you get off the elevator you'll spot a Giant chest to open as well as a
Rocket Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Storm of Sands (Rocket)                                                   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The thing in here starts after the first food zone, the mines will begin  |
 | to make circling movements making it difficult to know exactly how far    |
 | away you are from them, try to make good use of pausing before boosting   |
 | through a pair that are moving together and apart as there should be a    |
 | fair bit of extra time left over if you're boosting the rest of the way.  |
 |                                                                           |
 | Reward for completing it is [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - Jolly Greeble].     |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

To the left of the Rocket Zone is a path with a couple of mines floating about
on it, you can't actually destroy the mines (except by getting damaged by them)
so you'll just have to be careful when walking past them. At the end there is a
kangarat called Terrel who wants you to go inside to find a handle.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020603]      The Canteen (Magic)      [020603] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

To unlock the gate you need to jump on all four "Ho-Down Squares" without
touching the ground between them. You can hit the same one multiple times just
don't hit the floor. Use your shadow to help guide you where you're landing.
Once you've done it successfully the door at the back will swing open and
reveal the handle that Terrel was after. Pick it up and go outside.

Put it in place by approaching the switch and then pull it to bring out the
bridge.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020604]      Impenetrable Fort (Magic)      [020604] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Pirate Slamspins are your new enemy, these are similar to the Arkeyan
Rip-rotors in that they spin around in an invulnerable state for a while before
getting tired and stopping to let you attack them. Once you've killed one of
them a pair of Powderkegs will appear and start helping attack you, once all of
the enemies are dead you'll start being bombarded by the attack ships - stay
out of the red circles! Another Powderkeg, Slamspin and a Geargolem will appear
during this, take out the two smaller enemies while you work on defeating the
Geargolem in the middle.

Get into the cannon and fire yourself at the airship. Once you land you'll see
a Dual Air and Tech Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Sky Gear Gulch (Air)                                                      |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Go up onto the gear platform and pull the lever, that'll bring down some  |
 | more gears to jump up. Go along the middle path up to a larger rotating   |
 | platform with another lever in the middle. Pull it and then use the       |
 | bounce pad to the right to get up onto the tall stack of gears with a     |
 | third lever to pull. Jump down to the next platform and attack the four   |
 | Powderkegs that are circling the locked lever, once they're defeated the  |
 | lever will be able to be pulled. This brings down a gear with the present |
 | [Hat 1/2 - Gaucho Hat] on as well as a lever to get back to the entrance. |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Before going into the building use the bounce pad outside to get up onto the
roof of it. Up there is [Marshal Wheellock Plushy 3/5]. Drop down and head
inside.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020605]      Huckster's Hutch (Fire)      [020605] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Another Ho-Down Square task, this time they're moving so you'll really need to
pay attention to your shadow when you're jumping between them. Solving it opens
the door and gives you a way out.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020606]      Sun Smoked Strand (Fire)      [020606] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Another kangarat, Squink, wants you to find another missing handle. Before you
go inside the building on the left use the bounce pad next to it to get up on
its roof. In the middle you'll see a water tower with a [Treasure Chest 1/3]
hiding beneath it, the problem is the mines that are circling, luckily there's
a gap in the mines at one point so wait for it to come round before jumping and
smashing down the water tower.

Jump back down and go inside.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [020607]      Cuddy's Cottage (Fire)      [020607] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

The handle is over on the bed at the back on the right, kill the Slamshock and
the Chompy Pod first and then go pick it up. If you bounce on the bed several
times it'll break and spew out some coins, the bed in the left corner will also
spew out [Marshal Wheellock Plushy 4/5] if you bounce on it enough times to
break it.

Outside again get rid of a few Chompies and then pull the lever once you've put
it into place. Immediately as you get across you'll spot a Dig Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Submerged Sands (Dig)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This one has minecarts zooming back and forth through the darkness, stay  |
 | out of their way as they'll do a fair bit of damage if they hit you. The  |
 | bonus gems are all in the wrong direction down the tracks, your best      |
 | opportunity to get them is after digging up the second crystal. Reward    |
 | for digging up the third crystal is a [Winged Sapphire].                  |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go to the left of the Dig Zone and drop down off the edge to a section below
where there's a bunch of mines. Walk through the two moving ones to get to a
couple of Powderkegs that you'll want to defeat. Use the bounce pad behind the
second one to bounce up again to [Soul Gem 2/3 - Grim Creeper]. You're now
right above Marshal Wheellock so drop down but I'd say go into the building on
the right first.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020608]      Quaint Cottage (Fire)      [020608] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

In here is a Spark Lock "Let's Take This to the Next Level". Move Shock left
and then right to hit the blue and green buttons. Switch to Bolt and move him
left two spaces onto the green platforms, go back to Shock and press the green
button again to lift Bolt up (keep Shock on the button). Switch to Bolt and
grab the green lightning bolt. Then head to the bottom end of the green
platforms and go down to move to the left and press wait on the red platform.
Switch to Shock and stand on the currently lowered blue platform, switch to
Bolt and press the blue button. Have Shock go grab his lightning bolt before
doubling back down to where the sliding platforms meet, switch to Bolt and
bring them together to open up [Treasure Chest 2/3]. All there is in the beds
are coins.

Go into the house on the left to start looking for another missing handle.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020609]      Iron Jaw Inn (Fire)      [020609] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

A bit of a fight is going on in here, take out the Powderkegs and the Chompy
Pod to settle the score. Again the beds in here just dispense coins. Grab the
handle and go back outside to use it.

Over the bridge is a new enemy, the Evilized Kangarat. These are different to
previous Evilized things in their attack pattern, they'll jump up into the air
and create a target circle where they'll smash down. Once they've hit the
ground they'll be stuck for a few seconds so that's your chance to attack them.
With the first one defeated a whole load of Chompies will appear before being
joined by a second Evilized Kangarat and two Slamshocks. Once they're all gone
jump into the cannon and destroy the second airship.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020610]      10,000 Gallon Hat (Undead)      [020610] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Checkpoint! To the right of the Power Pod is a Tech Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Pump Station (Tech)                                                       |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Pull the lever to be taken up into a side-scrolling section. Go to the    |
 | right, there's loads of revolving and rotating gears to jump onto and     |
 | over, up some moving platforms, but all the time headed in the right      |
 | direction. At the end you'll pick up a [Legendary Treasure 2/2 - Tik-Tok  |
 | Neck Clock] off the floor (somebody forgot to wrap it!) and pull a lever  |
 | to get back out again.                                                    |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go left up past a single mine and then a set of four circling around. On the
far side of them is a door to go through.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020611]      Kangarat Groove Hut (Undead)      [020611] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

The setup in here is another load of Ho-Down Squares rotating about, remember
that you can bounce on squares that you've already bounced on so you can do it
in any order you like. Once you've managed it grab the handle from the back of
the room and go back outside to place it and pull it.

As you cross the bridge you should notice a second part of the bridge appear on
the left, double back and go up the steps that it forms to grab [Story Scroll],
careful of the mines. Jump down and continue along the lower bridge to a
circular area where some enemies attack. As you're taking out the two Evilized
Kangarats watch out for the Powderkegs shooting at you from above, be careful
not to jump into the cannonballs when you're getting out of the way. When one
Kangarat is defeated a Fire Geargolem will appear, once the second is gone the
Powderkegs will jump down to join. There's a Life Gate along the back wall.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Grooving Gardens (Life)                                                   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Jump up onto the large mushroom and interact to be taken away to some     |
 | more platforms. Head forwards and you'll notice that the platforms ahead  |
 | are actually Ho-Down Squares, some that are flipping over and some that   |
 | are just rotating, your task is to jump on each one of them without       |
 | falling off. To do that use the rotating ones to bounce on while you wait |
 | for the flipping ones to turn the right way round, your shadow should be  |
 | very useful here. The reward is in a present at the end, it's [Bonus      |
 | Mission Map 1/1 - Egg Royale].                                            |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Time to go right through the monster gate you just opened.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020612]      Okey-Dokey Corral (Undead)      [020612] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Go past a mine and then use the bounce pad next to a trio of mines to reach the
last of [Marshal Wheellock Plushy 5/5]. Over to the right of the mines is a
Teleport Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Hourglass Blink (Teleport)                                                |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This one introduces laser beams to avoid, you can see the crystals over   |
 | on the left side and hear them powering up to burst a light beam          |
 | horizontally across the platforms. Don't run into it, it hurts. The       |
 | platform layout is also a little odder, it's more of a plus sign than a   |
 | square this time. Reward is [Hat 2/2 - Zombeanie].                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go forwards past another mine to some enemies. Kill the Slamshocks and Chompies
and then smash the water tower on the left to find [Treasure Chest 3/3]
underneath it. A little further on kill the Chompy Pod to reveal a bounce pad
that'll let you get up to [Soul Gem 3/3 - Grilla Drilla] beneath another little
water tower. Go down and then up to the elevator at the end.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020613]      Last Train West (Undead)      [020613] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Time for the last fight of the level. Defeat the two Powederkegs in the middle
of the mines and a couple of Evilized Kangarats will start to attack, they're
just as easy to defeat as ever but watch out for the mines when you're moving
out of their way. With those down a Fire Geargolem and three Slamshocks will
turn up, take out the Slamshocks as you circle the Geargolem and finish him off
to complete the fight. Jump into the cannon to take out the final airship.

   ,--------------------------------------,
  | [020614]      Woodburrow      [020614] |
   '--------------------------------------'

We may be in a rush to get where we're going but there's apparently enough time
to return to Woodburrow and have a chat with somebody unrelated to the plot. A
Kangarat called Tibbet is now over in the Trophy Room, which is up the stairs
to the right of the Power Pod. He'll give you [Legendary Treasure - Navigator
Compass] and unlock the ability to finally use your Legendary Treasures.
Approach the pedestal next to him and press the interact button, select one of
your Legendary Treasures  that you like the bonus for and activate it. If you
wish to deactivate a Legendary Treasure you have to return to the pedestal you
put it on and choose a different Legendary Treasure to use, you can't actually
make it blank again.

And that is it. There are a few more Pedestals across Woodburrow but a lot of
them are restricted to needing a higher level Portal Master Rank. One that
you'll probably be able to use is at the entrance to the Great Hollow as it's
only level 54 required. Go talk to Tessa to get going to Motleyville.

Immediately into a fight, watch for the circle where Whiskers is about to slam
down and get away from it. As the burst of energy expands jump over it to avoid
getting damaged. Now quickly attack Whiskers while he's got his head stuck.
After about a quarter of his health is gone he'll start hitting the ground
three times before getting stuck but it's just the same as before with jumping
over the blasts. A little before half health he'll run off and leave you to do
some wandering through the level.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020701]      Arena Overlook (Undead)      [020701] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Follow Flynn, Tessa and Sharpfin through the gate and pull the switch over on
the left, that'll create a bridge to go over. The new Chompy Powerhouse enemies
are once again just Chompies dressed up a little differently. To your left
below the ramp you can find [Treasure Chest 1/5] hidden behind some junk.

Go up the slope and head left to where you meet a Greeble Heaver. These are a
lot like the Greeble Screwballs you met earlier in the game but fire several
shots up into the air instead of just one. Go up the right side to get to it
and then head into the glowing doorway with a stick of dynamite pictured above
it.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020702]      Arena Bomb Car (Undead)      [020702] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Aside from the boxes to destroy for coins all there is in here is a stick of
dynamite. This is exactly like the bombs from the previous games, pick it up
and quickly head outside as it's on a timer.

Throw the dynamite at the large wall with a purple picture of some dynamite on
it, you can do this by facing the wall and pressing the interact button that
will pop up. Over the bridge you'll find a Knuckleduster along with some
Chompies and a Heaver. Before you move on jump onto the red platform behind the
place it's telling you to go and then jump up to the left to where [Soul Gem
1/3 - Boom Jet] can be found. Jump back down and get onto the striped starting
point on the tracks.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [020703]      Abandoned MineTrack (Undead)      [020703] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

To switch the rail that you're grinding along all you have to do is move left
or right, try to avoid the mines that are in the way. After a bit you'll start
needing to jump over obstacles lying across the track. At the end is some food
to eat.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020704]      Soggy Fields (Undead)      [020704] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Walk up to the right but watch out for the green goop as it'll damage you if
you fall in. Go along it to the left to meet the Gookeeper before jumping along
some floating tyres to cross over it. Towards the screen at the end is
[Treasure Chest 2/5] hidden back there. Push the minecart along the tracks so
you can jump up onto it and the platform above.

Watch out for the Heaver and the two Rip-rotors that attack you up here, on the
left is a Fire Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Lava Fields (Fire)                                                        |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Go right when you get to where Lone Shark was standing and cross over the |
 | large slowly rotating round platform, watch out for the lava blasts. Keep |
 | on going round until you reach the present, the only real obstacle is     |
 | that the blasts get a bit more frequent the further along you go. Inside  |
 | the present is [Hat 1/2 - Roundlet]. A new set of platforms will appear   |
 | that you can jump down to reach the entrance.                             |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Push the cart off to the right so that you can use it to get across to the
section there. Avoid the swinging hook and kill the Chompies that dig out of
the ground. On the right is a small gap in the fence which you can go through
to pick up [Toy Train 1/5]. Go through a pair of swinging hooks before jumping
down to the right to another minecart.

Push it up against the wall to jump up to the Heavers and a couple of
Rip-rotors above. After clearing them and a few more out the monster lock will
open and let you get [Treasure Chest 3/5]. Go right over the wooden bridge and
down off the little ledge towards a small wooden section sticking out, jump
from it to a large rock that's balancing precariously, jump over to the
platform after it to find [Soul Gem 2/3 - Night Shift]. Jump back over and then
across the metal bridge further up.

Defeat the Slamshock and accompanying Heavers and then go up the upturned train
cars on the right to get to [Treasure Chest 4/5] above the glowing doorway.
Jump down and go into the building.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [020705]      Bomb Bay (Undead)      [020705] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

Pick up the dynamite and head outside again.

Quickly go left over the metal bridge and throw the dynamite at the wall to the
north. If you talk with Clunker behind there you'll be shown the way forward,
down some steps at the back. We'll be back for the cannon walls later.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [020706]      Lester's Lane (Magic)      [020706] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Follow Clunker down to a switch that you need to pull in order to bring a
bridge out. Go left over the bridge where you can see a Speed Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Drag Stripped (Speed)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The new obstacle in here is moving mines, you'll have to quickly work out |
 | which lane will be safe when you reach the mine as it may be headed right |
 | towards that large open gap you're looking at. Remember to keep boosting  |
 | in order to make it to the end in time. The reward for finishing is a     |
 | [Winged Sapphire].                                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

There's another dynamite wall ahead so you'll first need to find some dynamite,
go right over the goo and into the dynamite room.

   ,------------------------------------------------,
  | [020707]      Shady Shoppe (Magic)      [020707] |
   '------------------------------------------------'

There's a couple of Knuckledusters in here, once you kill them a few Chompies
will appear and then the monster gate will open to reveal a Slamshock. If you
like you can now use the dynamite behind it to blow it up. Grab the dynamite
once it's clear and run outside.

Go back to the left and blow up the wall near the Speed Zone. That'll lead
through some swinging crane hooks to [Toy Train 2/5]. Jump down and grab
another stick of dynamite to throw at the wall on the right.

Talk to Gibbs and then head inside his shop, watch out for the large crates out
here as they contain some enemies.

   '---------------------------------------------------------'

The large boxes contain enemies in here too, get to the back of the shed to
find [Toy Train 3/5] before going back outside again.

Go up the steps towards Gibb and fire the cannon at the cannon wall. Push it
and then follow after it along the tracks, kill the Chompies that appear as you
get there and then fire the cannon at another wall, then it's time for another
push along the tracks. Yep, more Chompies once you reach it, fire it again and
give it another shove. On the right of the track at the end is a lever that'll
lift the cannon up to the higher track.

Go up the walkway that it also creates and fire the cannon again. Push the
cannon backwards towards the lift and then fire it another time to hit the far
wall. Watch out for the enemies coming across the bridge but head through the
second broken wall instead.

That'll take you along the side of a train car down to a goo pit, jump up the
platforms in the middle of it to reach [Story Scroll]. Now go back up and cross
over the bridge to get to a fight.

  | [020709]      Ghost Town (Magic)      [020709] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

A new type of Geargolem, an Earth Geargolem will appear. These aren't any
tougher than the Fire ones they just do the circular pulse along the ground
attack instead of the small line of fire. It does mean that you need to
actually jump over their attack but they're just as useless at doing anything
else. They are more difficult with other enemies though as you'll need to keep
an eye on what the Geargolem is doing while also attacking everyone else, which
is what you're about to do as defeating the first Geargolem will bring in some
Knuckledusters, a Heaver and another Geargolem all at once.

Go through the exit once it opens up and hop onto the tracks as you did before,
there's nothing else to collect before you do so.

Yet more obstacles to avoid along the way, you might want to try jumping over
the mines as they have a tendancy to move into your path. Checkpoint!

   '--------------------------------------------------'

Go to the left keeping away from the circles on the ground being made by
Whiskers, after jumping up the first ledge jump up onto the box in the back
right corner and then up onto a wooden platform leading backwards to get [Soul
Gem 3/3 - Scorp]. Drop back down and jump over the gap to get close to where
Whiskers is standing. Follow the path to the right and push the minecart onto
the lift to open the door next to it.

   '-------------------------------------------------'

Pull the switch in the middle of the next bit of track and then push the cart
there onto another elevator. Before you go through that gate there's a Giant
chest up to the left and if you go down to the right there's a cave underneath
to go into for completion, or you could just fall into the whirlpool in the
middle of the goo to get taken down there.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020713]      Beneath The Sand (Magic)      [020713] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

There's not much in here so unless you want to pick up a few coins just turn
around and go back up again. There are a few enemies that appear once you get
to the back of the tunnel.

Once you go through the gate jump onto one of the floating tyres and ride it to
the opposite side, go down the slope and attack the enemies that pop out of the
ground. Hit the switch to bring up a bridge. Make your way past the swinging
hooks up a slope with a Dual Air and Water Gate on the side.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Walk into the bounce pad to get up to a set of enemies to defeat, they're |
 | mostly Knuckledusters. The water jet rotating in the middle might push    |
 | you a little off course so watch out for then when dodging attacks.       |
 | Bounce up to another platform with some enemies on, this time it's        |
 | Heavers you're after. Another bounce up will take you to two more Heavers |
 | and no Chompies to finish off the section. Through the gate behind them   |
 | is [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Sleepy Turtles].                              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Carry on up the slope and go left following the tracks. At a junction you'll
get to fight some more Heavers and Knuckledusters. Once they're all gone push
the minecart down the path you just came up, don't use the switch! Jump onto
the minecart at the bottom and use it to get up onto the platform at the end
where [Toy Train 4/5] is. Get down and push the cart back up, now you can hit
the switch and push it to the right again (if you can manage to jump up onto
the cart while it's moving you'll be able to reach a little bit of bonus
treasure before it goes onto the elevator).

Discovered a second time anyway. On the left is a Climb Swap Zone.

 | Now you've got sawblades moving back and forth in your way. And from the  |
 | second part you'll have falling minecarts taking out your cover (as well  |
 | as damaging you if you get hit by them). The reward for managing to get   |
 | to the top is [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - The Bling Grille].                |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Walk up the slope to Birdwatcher and then down into the arena with Whiskers.

It's a very similar fight to the one you were doing at the start of the level.
First watch out for the three bursts as he crashes down and then gets his head
stuck. After coming up from that he'll now fire off a series of attacks at you
like he did on the trains not too long ago, just move ahead of them to avoid
getting damaged. And then he'll get back to smashing down into the ground a few
times. After about half health when he gets up from being stunned he'll fire
off a powerful laser beam in front of himself which you should obviously try to
avoid. Other than that it's the same the rest of the way through.

on the left.

  | [020716]      Red Crab Fireworks (Life)      [020716] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Very useful, nothing but coins in here. Leave and jump onto the tracks.

Partway along the second portion of the tracks you'll start having mines come
towards you, try to get out of their way as early as possible as you'll hit
them very quickly if you don't.

At the end you'll need to fight some enemies, an Earth Geargolem, two
Knuckledusters and then two Rip-rotors afterwards.

 | Teleporting without a teleporting Swap Force character even needed. Pick  |
 | up the glowing white ball and throw it towards the larger glowing white   |
 | ball ahead of you by facing towards it and pressing the interact button.  |
 | If it lands on the platform correctly you'll be teleported over there,    |
 | then use the white ball to teleport to the rest of the course.            |
 |                                                                           |
 | There's no time limit on holding one of these teleport balls but if you   |
 | miss you'll have to pick up another one. Pick up the teleport ball from   |
 | up on the right to teleport over the next gap, a couple of Knuckledusters |
 | will attack you once you land. The next one is from on top of a giant     |
 | revolving gear, get on the left side of it and wait until you get to the  |
 | top before throwing the teleport ball to the next platform. If you miss   |
 | you'll have to go back around and try again.                              |
 |                                                                           |
 | There's a moving platform that'll take you over to a second large gear    |
 | that you need to use a teleport ball on top of. Do not use the large      |
 | teleporter ball here as it'll just exit the area, instead grab the small  |
 | one from the right and throw it to a platform in the distance ahead of    |
 | you when the gear inbetween is in its lower position. The next teleport   |
 | jump has another large gear blocking the way, wait for it to roll out of  |
 | the way before throwing the ball to get over to another pair of           |
 | Knuckledusters. Now this large teleport ball is the one you want to use,  |
 | it'll take you back to the beginning and give you the present with        |
 | [Legendary Treasure 2/2 - Crooked Currency].                              |

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Now we've got mines to mess you up, try to avoid them as best you can but |
 | there's food dotted around that can help you recover a little. I have hit |
 | them without getting damaged but I'm not entirely sure why not (maybe     |
 | it's just your armor stat?). This is one of the places where being on an  |
 | easier mode really can make it that much easier, on the harder            |
 | difficulties you'll take more damage from the mines so on the easy ones   |
 | you don't have to be anywhere near as careful. The reward for destroying  |
 | the Kaos Statue at the end is [Hat 2/2 - Capuchon].                       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Another whirlpool ahead, you can either go down the slope to the left and go
into the room and work your way through it backwards or you can jump onto one
of the tyres and then straight into the middle of the whirlpool to be taken to
the back of it immediately.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020718]      Under The Whirl (Earth)      [020718] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

On the right at the back of the cave is [Treasure Chest 5/5], shake it open and
then go forwards to the exit. There's a few enemies to get out of the way and
you'll want to jump over the green goo.

Before you jump back onto the floating tyres jump onto the upturned minecart on
the left then up onto the buildings above it. Get rid of the Heavers and jump
down to the glowing [Toy Train 5/5] at the end on the right. Jump all the way
down to what is the other side of the whirlpool section.

Kill the Greeble Heavers down here and then start pushing the carts, the right
one first without pulling the lever. That'll take it to the right below a
Heaver that's shooting at you from above. Jump up onto the cart to get to it
and then go into the dynamite room behind him.

Take the dynamite outside and throw it at the wall to the left.

Drop down and hit the switch before pushing the left cart, it'll go onto a lift
and open up the door behind the dynamite wall fully.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [020720]      Shark Town (Earth)      [020720] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

Through the gate jump onto the wooden platform in the goop on the left, jump
again to reach some enemies. Once you've taken out the Heaver, the two
Rip-rotors and the Geargolem the door at the back on the left will open to let
you through.

  | [020721]      Motleyville Mall (Earth)      [020721] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

The final area of the level, time to fight Baron Von Shellshock. He'll start
throwing bombs at you, as well as a few Chompies, the last of those bombs will
turn into a stick of dynamite that you will need to pick up and throw back at
him. That'll damage him and lower his shield briefly, if you can get in close
and attack him until he gets back up again. As you do about 25% damage you'll
be joined by a few Rip-rotors too but Shellshock won't really do much different
aside from throwing more bombs out before getting to the dynamite. At 50% it's
a Heaver that appears and then at 75% down you'll get three Knuckledusters
attack. You can use the dynamite to help defeat those enemies as well as
Shellshock.

  | [020722]      Woodburrow      [020722] |
   '--------------------------------------'

The game wants you to go talk to Sharpfin but there's a few things you can do
in Woodburrow first. If you go down to the fishing hold that Wheellock just
unlocked, through the door in the area below the Power Pod, you can find a
[Story Scroll] to the right as well as an elemental door. If you place an Air
element Skylander near the door it'll open to reveal a second door, that one
requires an Earth Skylander. Behind that? A Magic door! And that's the last of
the doors, behind there is [Soul Gem - Smolderdash] and a few coins. You can
keep coming back here to open the doors to get more coins later on.

The fishing mini-game down here is just for fun, well there's a small coin
reward but nothing amazing. Head back up and go talk to Sharpfin to get moving
to Twisty Tunnels.

   '----------------------------------------------'

Straight on off the ship and across a tentacle bridge to meet a Cadet Crusher.
Basically just a Troll version of the basic Greeble, it'll run up to you and
smash its hammer down in front of it. It leaves a bit of purple fire for a
brief moment but that's really just to tell you not to walk into the hammer
when it's still on the ground, the fire by itself won't damage you but the
hammer will even if you miss the initial smash.

Go down the tentacle after defeating them to get to a Fire Geargolem and a few
more Crushers along with a load of Chompies. Once you've taken all of them down
go over to the left side of the area where [Treasure Chest 1/5] is hiding on
the stone circle. Now go talk to Sharpfin to get dropped down to the next bit.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020802]      Perilous Plateau (Tech)      [020802] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Go to your right and off the edge of the tentacle to a ledge below, smash
through the piled up boxes and you'll find [Treasure Chest 2/5]. Go back up the
steps and talk to Baron Sharpfin over near the Sneak Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 | A sidescrolling version of the sneak zone this time, the cameras are      |
 | lighting up the wall instead of the floor but it's the same thing really. |
 | Go right past the first camera and onto a moving platform, if you want    |
 | the bonus gem continue to the right when the lift is in the lower         |
 | position, the gem is past another couple of lasers. Ride the lift up and  |
 | go left over a laser and then past a camera and open up the door.         |
 |                                                                           |
 | Drop down the gap to the left and keep going to the bottom, go right past |
 | a camera and onto some more moving platforms, if you wnt the second bonus |
 | gem then let the second one take you to the top where you can go left and |
 | drop down to it. Continue to the right where there's another door to turn |
 | open.                                                                     |

 | Go all the way to the right and wait above the camera, watching out for   |
 | the two lasers guarding the hole. Wait for the camera to move to the left |
 | before dropping down and then quickly further down to the right, if you   |
 | want the bonus gem keep pushing to the right so that you land on the      |
 | ledge there, the gem is just past the camera that's on the right. Drop    |
 | down and go left up another moving platform left past another camera and  |
 | then ride the moving platforms up to the right and then up onto a smaller |
 | moving platform. Go left through the camera and then down to the end      |
 | button. The reward it will give is [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - Moltenskin   |
 | Scale].                                                                   |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Up the slope next to it is [Story Scroll].

Sharpfin will hint towards the spade sticking out of the ground, pick it up
with the interact button and then follow the dashed line towards an X that
marks the spot. Dig up the spot to get a few coins but not much else, follow
the path again and keep digging up the spots until you get to the last one with
a key. Use it on the gate to the left.

And another new enemy, this one's a Boom Boss. These fire barrels of explosives
at you, even if they miss on the first bounce you still need to avoid them as
they'll soon explode. On the left side is an Air Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Fairly simple one this, just avoid the mines as the platform you're on    |
 | moves through the sky. At the end is [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Magic       |
 | Cells].                                                                   |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

On the right side of the area where you just fought the Boom Bosses jump up the
first stepped platforms and then smash through the boxes piled up on the right,
go down through the gap and along the path to the left following it around to
[Rubber Duckies 1/5]. Go back up and jump onto the platform that's moving
vertically.

Up top there's a monster gate to get through before you can reach the crystal.
Take out the two Crushers to bring in a pair of Bosses while taking out the
Geargolem too. Once that's clear go through the gate and approach the crystal.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020803]      Crystal Crashing (Tech)      [020803] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Go up the pink platform and left onto a section with a rotating electrified
arm, you can either jump over it to avoid getting shocked or follow it around
and just walk to the next ramp. The next one looks like it has two ways to go
but the left one is actually just a way back from the platform above it, so go
straight across and then take the left path on the third rotating arm to go up
the series of platforms and reach [Rubber Duckies 2/5].

Now make your way back to the third arm and continue up the platforms to the
right, this'll take you to a pair of arms that you need to get through, just
walk through following the direction of the arms and you should be okay. When
you get to the wires spin each of the screws out of place to destroy and exit
the crystal.

Jump down off the rotating tentacles to the right where you'll find a spade to
pick up, use it to dig up the area where it indicates and you'll find [Treasure
Chest 3/5]. Now use the bounce pad at the left end to get back up and cross
over those tentacles properly.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020804]      Guardian Gangway (Tech)      [020804] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Take out the two Crushers and the Boss at the back before smashing through the
crates behind them. Head to the right as the Fire Viper starts trying to attack
you, just keep out of the red circle and you'll be okay. Smash through some
more crates to get to some revolving tentacles. Again you'll want to drop off
them to the side to get to a section below, go along to the far end, past some
Chompies, to a glowing cave.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [020805]      Sandy Cavern (Tech)      [020805] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

At the back of the cave you'll see a chest locked by monsters, they'll quickly
appear to fight you. That's about four Crushers before a few Bosses join in. A
Geargolem will also soon join along with the usual waves of Chompies. Once
they're all finally gone you can open up [Treasure Chest 4/5]. You get out the
same way you came in.

Go up the rising platform to get back to the revolving tentacles and make your
way through another pile of crates to an area with three circular pools of
sand. Jump into the one to the right.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [020806]      Sandstone Secret (Tech)      [020806] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

You'll be falling down, move to collect the coins and, as long as you went down
the right-hand pool, at the bottom is [Soul Gem 1/3 - Rip Tide]. Go down to the
left past a Giant chest and down to a mushroom that you can use to bounce back
up to the surface.

Go into the cave.

   ,--------------------------------------------,
  | [020807]      Arid Cave (Fire)      [020807] |
   '--------------------------------------------'

The Air Spellpunk arrives, these speed up nearby enemies so that they can move
and attack faster. So yeah, the Spellpunk should be a priority when it's
around. When it's by itself it will also fire out tornadoes at you so be
careful of those.

Go through the monster gate and bounce up on the pad to get near to the exit,
don't go through the exit yet though, go to the left down to [Rubber Duckies
3/5]. Now you can leave.

Out above the pools of sand now, bounce up to the path above.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [020808]      Hazardous Highway (Fire)      [020808] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Go right along the path to have the Fire Viper appear and introduce some fiery
mines. Before jumping up the little ledge to those mines go through the gap in
the fence and backwards to the left where [Soul Gem 2/3 - Wash Buckler] is
located. Go back up the slope and onto the fire mine area being careful of the
initial ones swirling around.

Go over a purple tentacle carefully avoiding the mines circling around it to
get to a Boom Boss and then the second crystal.

  | [020809]      Energetic Evilizer (Fire)      [020809] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

The arms in here are pretty much the same except that aside from the first one
they all have three arms on them instead of two. Go through the first two and
then up to a pair right next to each other, there's a third just after but
there's a little gap between to pause. Keep on following these up to the wire,
do not pull the wire just yet! Instead carry on further up the platforms to
reach [Rubber Duckies 4/5], the arms in the way are a lot quicker at spinning
so you'll have to jump over these ones a fair bit. Return to the wire to pull
it out and destroy the crystal.

Speak to Sharpfin to be dropped down once again, watch out for the mines around
the edge as you're falling. Checkpoint!

 | Go through the doorway and into the proper part of the zone. After        |

Take the path left to meet the Air Geargolem. These jump up into the air and
then slam down onto the ground where you are (or rather, were). They don't do
damage when in the air but do try to pull you towards them, the damage done is
just all around them when they hit the ground so they're fairly harmless as
long as you move out of their way when they fly up. It's just one of them now,
go up the stepped platforms at the back.

Walk over the rotating tentacles avoiding the mines, no point in going off the
side this time. Go over to the bounce pad on the right and then cross left over
some more tentacles while avoiding the circling mines. Go up the lift and then
right over  another tentacle and up a bounce pad. Just before you go into the
door at the left end up here smash the crates to reveal a bounce pad. Go right
along the tentacles avoiding all the incoming mines and you'll be able to get
[Soul Gem 3/3 - Fire Kraken]. Jump back down and go through the door.

 | The added feature this time is a giant fan circling the platform, it'll   |
 | push you around if you're directly in the gust of wind. Luckily there's   |
 | no mines this time so the only thing you need to be careful of is falling |
 | off the edge so watch out with your Super Spins. The reward for this zone |
 | is a [Winged Sapphire].                                                   |

 | Go up to the waterfall and jump onto the large moving bounce pad, keep on |

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up the tentacle path and at the top immediately go left and jump over a
suspended stone block to reach [Rubber Duckies 5/5]. Now go to the right onto
Sharpfin's ship to talk to him to begin a turret mini-game.

Shoot down the ships that fly past. Because this is more about survival by the
time you get to the second and third stages you'll want to make sure to try not
to let any missiles hit you, they should be your main focus with hitting the
ships themselves just behind.

 | New gimmick this time is moving platforms, and fire. Bounce on them       |
 | several times while you wait for it to reach a position where you can     |
 | jump to the next platform. And watch out when they move over the flames,  |
 | the rest of the time the flames shouldn't cause too much hassle. Reward   |
 | for reaching the third balloon is [Hat 2/2 - Tricorn Hat].                |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Careful of the mines as you walk back towards the ship to take the left path.
There's an Air Spell Punk ahead helping the Crusher and the others. Take them
all out to cross over another tentacle and see the Fire Viper again. Destroy
the Air Geargolem and his Air Spell Punk friend that makes him a lot more
dangerous. Take the left path here through a load of mines while also avoiding
the Fire Viper's attack to get [Treasure Chest 5/5].

Get back to the right and then go forwards up the tentacle towards the last
crystal, there's a Boom Boss in the middle to slow you down a little getting
there but other than the mines that's it.

The double arms in here are tall so you can't jump over them, you'll have to
follow them around now, the triple ones are still low enough to jump over
though. Once you make it to the end pull out the two wires to complete the
level.

Defeat Fire Viper No Skylanders Defeated No Damage Taken

Straight into a boss fight. Despite what Sharpfin says you don't need to wait
for him to do anything, the catapults are already loaded. Go to each of them
and fire them once at the Fire Viper, you just need to avoid the red circles
where the fireballs he's firing at you hit. After getting both plungers
attached to him the Fire Viper's head will come close enough that you can start
attacking the purple crystals on it.

Stay out of the green goop and make your way to one of the catapults to fire it
again, then hide in the shadow behind one of the two massive tentacles that
pops up to avoid getting hit by the Fire Viper's fire breath. Run over to the
other catapult and fire that one again too. Now attack the crystals on his head
again.

The third phase begins with the Fire Viper adding some mines that you'll need
to avoid. Do the same as usual, fire the two catapults and then attack his
head. The fourth brings back the fire breath again so hide behind another
tentacle while he does that. After you've smashed the last of the crystals on
his head we head inside.

Avoid the purple fire bursts coming out of the sides as you fall down and get
into a fight with a trio of Fire Geargolems. Once they're defeated go to the
back and smash that final crystal to defeat the boss.

Go over to the Trophy Room near the Power Pod and jump up the brown mushrooms
on the left side to get to where Tessa and Wheellock are. They've got a turret
for you to play with if you want, you don't actually have to have a go. The
general idea in there is to only hit the lava rocks and crates and not the
mines that fly by after the first round, so make sure to be careful when firing
rather than just holding the shoot button the whole time as hitting a mine is
an instant fail. Once you're done with the turret go talk to Sharpfin to get
going to Boney Islands.

Go down the steps to the two Fire Geargolems and take them out, you can run
around them to make them attack each other if you can get them close together.
Talk to Avril once you're done to get moving.

   '----------------------------------------------'

Slide along the ice to meet a Coldspear Cyclops. These are again an enemy
that'll run towards you and try to stab you with its spear. Kill them and then
push the yellow block of amber backwards into a hole behind it. Jump up the
wooden steps on the left to reach [Treasure Chest 1/5]. Jump back down and
follow the caravan.

The caravan will pause to let you attack a Geargolem and a few Coldspears
before tackling a block puzzle. Push the near one to the right and it'll slide
all the way into the hole. Then push the left one away and the right one to the
right into the hole. Push the remaining block right and then down into the hole
as well.

Before going through the gate that the caravan shoots open go down the wooden
path to the left, it'll lead to a small gap to jump over before reaching
[Museum Souvenirs 1/4]. Now go back up and through the gate to a quick block
puzzle. Push the first block to the right, then the block that was behind it
backwards. Push the far block to the left and then the remaining block into a
hole ahead of you.

Go through the next gate where you'll be introduced to the Cyclops Gazermage.
These stand still and point their magnifying glass at you, get out of the way
of the beam before it turns orange otherwise you'll take damage. With the two
of them defeated the caravan will move in, keep on along side and another group
of enemies will appear. Take out the Coldspears and the Gazermages that keep
appearing until Avril asks you to go find gas.

Bounce up by the amber and follow the path, as it turns to the right jump off
to the left onto some rotating circular platforms. At the top is [Soul Gem 1/2
- Spy Rise]. Get back to the path and follow it a short distance further to see
a Cyclops Snowblaster. These stationary turrets fire out blasts of ice directly
in front of them, this one doesn't even turn. Get past one of the blasts and by
its side to attack freely.

Up the steps to a quick light beam puzzle, or, well, not really a puzzle at
all. Push the crystal left and you're done. Through the gate you'll see a
couple of Coldspears being helped by an Air Spell Punk, if you walk back
through the gate you can lure the Coldspears into the beam of light and they'll
take damage from it. Once they're gone push the amber block into a hotspring by
the wall. Jump onto it it'll spring upwards letting you reach the higher
platform.

There's a Chompy Frostflower up here. When bit by one of these you'll be slowed
down for a moment but otherwise they are just the same as the other Chompies.
On the left is a Dual Magic and Life Gate.

 | Go up the steps and push the amber block south off the platform, jump     |
 | down and push it left three times to go over the edge, jump down onto it  |
 | to ride it up to the next platform and ride the block there up further    |
 | again. Watch out for the Gazermages above as you clear out the one on the |
 | same level as you and the Snowblaster at the back that's slowly rotating. |
 | Now start pushing the blocks, push the back one out of the way to the     |
 | right and then the front one onto the grill back to the left careful not  |
 | to be stuck in a pushing animation while the Gazermages are focusing on   |
 | you.                                                                      |

 | Ride the block up to the top layer and take out the two Gazermages as     |
 | well as another Snowblaster at the back. Go along to the right side where |

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Into the house on the right.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [021003]      Relic Room (Water)      [021003] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

At the back is a Spark Lock, "Synchronized Sliding". The ticking noise you can
hear is the fans turning off and on again, you'll need to do some timing with
that in a moment. First get Shock to go through the fan when it's off, you'll
hit the purple button at the back. The best time to move is a second or two
after the fan turns on. Now go back down to the lowered purple platforms and
stand on the middle of the three. Switch to Bolt. Again go past the fan with it
off to hit the orange button, if you time it wrong you'll just come back around
so you can try again. Take Bolt back down and approach Shock but do not bump
into him, instead go up onto the moving platform to get around him. Now you can
safely try to go upwards and use the fan to be blown to the right onto the
moving platform and let yourself go through the green lightning bolt. Do the
same on the right side with Shock and then bring them together along the
bottom. That'll solve [Treasure Chest 2/5]. Head outside again.

Go up the steps between the gate and the building to reach a locked gate and
another building to go inside.

A little more of a puzzle this time, pull the lever on the right twice so that
the beam of light is going straight to the left. Then push the crystal down
into the beam and then right so that it hits the crystal on the door to reveal
a key.

Take the key outside, defeat the two Coldspears that have appeared and then
unlock the gate.

Jump into the caravan and start shooting at the ice blockade. The caravan will
start moving along the path and your job is now to shoot the enemies that pop
up before they can damage you, the Snowblasters are suddenly a much more
dangerous enemy. Just keep on shooting at everything that you can get a lock-on
circle on.

 | Again you've got a massive item falling down smashing through the cover,  |
 | in this case it's fossilised fish, you should be able to hear it from a   |
 | distance so listen out for that as well as watching out for the red       |
 | circles of the missiles. Climb to the top to receive [Bonus Mission Map   |
 | 1/1 - Royal Gems].                                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go right over the brown rocks where the icicles are falling, keep out of the
way of the red circles as you make your way over to a Snowblaster in the
middle. A little past that you'll encounter a Loose Cannon, these are larger
Troll enemies with shields that fire out three cannon balls each time they
attack. Get up close and circle around it waiting for the third shot before
attacking it until it puts its shield back up. Repeat until it's defeated. And
a little further on is another Loose Cannon, that'll open up a monster gate
ahead. However don't go through it just yet.

Instead go back a little and to the right to jump along a series of ice
platforms to reach [Museum Souvenirs 2/4] on top of a frozen T-Rex skeleton.
Jump back down and head left to a Magic Gate.

 | Head down a ramp and push a light beam crystal ahead twice. There's a     |
 | lever next to it to pull, pull it. Now up the ramp to the right and start |
 | pushing some blocks. Push the right one back twice and then the left one  |
 | to the left twice, then push the remaining block up once and then finally |
 | push the crystal here to the right once to finish this bit of the         |
 | circuit. Go to the right and pull the lever next to the next crystal      |
 | twice to turn it to face another crystal ahead.                           |
 |                                                                           |
 | Go to that crystal and pull the lever three times. Jump down to the layer |
 | below on the left and push the crystal right twice and then onto the lift |
 | which you should lift up using the lever next to it. Go back up the steps |
 | and push the orange block left out of the way to finally open up the gate |
 | and find [Hat 1/2 - Fishbone Hat].                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Now go through the monster gate and attack the Geargolem and his two Gazerbeam
pals. Once they're gone more enemies will join including an Air Spell Punk
another Geargolem and a couple of Coldspears. With them dead you'll have a
quick chat with Avril and Flynn again.

Go to the right of the area and follow the path around through the falling
icicles and a Snowblaster to get to [Treasure Chest 3/5]. The icicles will
still be falling as you go back to the fight area. On the left side up on the
platform is an orange block, push it down off the platform and then far to the
right until you get it into the hole. Jump onto it and then off at the top.
There's a Dig Swap Zone up here.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The minecarts in here are moving a lot quicker than before but as they're |
 | coming towards you you'll be able to see them and move out of the way     |
 | just as quickly. First cross the cart tracks to the left and get the      |
 | first crystal, then you've got enough time to go grab the bonus gem to    |
 | the right of the start before coming back and heading further down the    |
 | cart track a little, on the right side should be a path off towards the   |
 | second crystal and the second bonus gem a little beyond. Get back to the  |
 | main dual cart track and carry on further down to the bonus gem and then  |
 | third crystal. The reward for digging up all three crystals is [Legendary |
 | Treasure 2/2 - Triassic Tooth].                                           |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up to the amber block on the left and push it off the edge, follow it down
and push it further left up against the steps. Jump onto the block and grab the
[Soul Gem 2/2 - Dune Bug] from the ledge above it. Use the block in the hole to
get back up to the higher up section and carry on along the path to another
amber block. Push that into the hole near it to go up the next ledge and into a
building.

Push the amber block off the edge to get it out of the way and then pull the
lever on the left to raise the crystal up. Turn the wheel by the crystal on the
right three times to open the door.

Go up the steps and across the platforms to a quick battle with a Gazermage.
Behind the amber blocks is a path to [Museum Souvenirs 3/4]. Push the left
block out of the way and then the right one left and then into the hole. Use it
to jump up onto another block that'll jump up to another and then finally to
the top. Kill the Gazermages and the Chompies as well as the Coldspears and the
Loose Cannon that come running across the bridge to you. Go inside the building
across the bridge first.

A timed challenge! You've got to quickly defeat all of the enemies in here to
open up the gate at the back and reveal [Story Scroll]. Now back out, across
the bridge and into the building.

Push the near block to the right four times and then backwards three times so
it falls off the ledge. Now the other one off the ledge too so that the light
beam hits the door and unlocks it. Go outside. Checkpoint!

 | The gates in this Swap Zone are not all in a straight line this time,     |
 | gotta weave through the first section, the second section makes them      |
 | start rotating as well. To get through those you'll need to either get    |
 | lucky with the positioning or move sideways through them. Reward for      |
 | safely reaching the end is [Hat 2/2 - Bearskin Cap].                      |

Talk to the front caravan to get it to shoot the lock on the gate so you can
walk through.

Kill the two Gazermages and then push the right of the two left blocks forward
out of the way to push the left one into the hole on the right. Now push the
first block to the right and then down into the gap ahead. Push the block up on
the platform down onto the ice and then over the block you just pushed into the
gap.

Cross over those blocks and jump up onto the wooden platform to get rid of the
Loose Cannon up there. And at the right end is [Treasure Chest 4/5]. Over to
the left side is another block puzzle. First push the middle one to the right
and into the gap, then push the one closest to the caravan to the left against
the side so that you can push the far one into it and then across on top of the
first block.

Chompies. Jump towards the screen onto a wooden platform and then again to find
[Museum Souvenirs 4/4]. Jump back to the path and head left into an Earth Gate.

 | Turn the wheel once so that you can reach the platform to the right, go   |
 | over there and fight the Geargolem and the Chompy Pod to open up the gate |
 | behind them. You'll find a key. Go back to the middle of the turning      |
 | platform and turn the wheel again so that you can get over to the left    |
 | side. This one's an Air Spell Punk with four Gazermages shooting really   |
 | quickly. Again grab the key and return to the central platform to turn it |
 | around so you can go to the back section.                                 |
 |                                                                           |
 | Use the two keys on the locked door to get the [Winged Sapphire]. You can |
 | just jump down and go back up the ramp towards the exit.                  |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up the little wooden ramp and jump onto one of the platforms rotating about
the dinosaur skeleton. Grab the key and then jump onto the wooden platform on
the left, wait for a second platform to come around before jumping on and then
straight back onto the same wooden platform with the key from it. For the third
one jump on again but ride it to the wooden platform at the far end.

Take out the two Loose Cannons and before you use the three keys on the locked
gate go down the steps to the left and into the building.

Pull the right lever to lift the right block into the air. Push the left block
up one and then right one onto the wooden lift and then pull the left lever.
Now push the bottom left crystal (the one facing left) to the right so it's in
the light beam. Next push the other crystal left twice and then down once into
the beam to unlock the gate. [Treasure Chest 5/5] is behind there.

Open up the gate with your three keys and follow the path along to a Chompy
Pod, a few Coldspears and a Loose Cannon up on a platform at the back. With
them gone take the Fossil Fuel can and start collecting the three keys from the
next set of rotating platforms, same thing as before but get rid of the two
Gazermages first. Get back to the caravan to go into one last shooting section.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021013]      Fossil Frostway (Tech)      [021013] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Shoot the purple eyes of the two dinosaur skeletons on either side to clear up
the bridge. Now get ready to shoot everything you can target as the caravan
dives down the icy path. There are mines, barricades, more purple eyes, enemies
and loads of crates to hit. All the way to the end of the level.

Absolutely nothing new to do in Woodburrow this time, just go talk to Sharpfin
to get moving to Winter Keep.

  | [021101]      The Blizzard Bridges (Tech)      [021101] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

Go straight ahead over the bridge next to Duff, avoid the red targeting circles
as you go past a couple of buildings and meet some Cyclops Sleetthrowers. These
are the type of enemy that throws a single projectile (a snowball) into the air
which comes down at the red circle marked on the floor. The only thing
different to these ones is that you get a bit frozen and slow down if you get
hit.

After taking out the three of them go up the slope behind to get to another
Sleetthrower as well as a Coldspear at the top. If you carry on ahead instead
up going through the monster gate up to the left you'll find [Story Scroll]
behind some crates on the left side of the path as you go up towards a Spin
Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Frozen Top (Spin)                                                         |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | It's very much back to basics in here, no mines, no wind, no nothing.     |
 | Just the regular obstacles and spinning. The reward for smashing the Kaos |
 | Statue is [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Ghost Traps].                          |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go back along the path to the monster gate and head left over the bridge
towards another monster gate.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [021102]      The Blue Ice Battlements      [021102] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

Another new enemy, a Twistpick Cyclops. And it's a spinning enemy that you have
to avoid while it's spinning, you'll also see a red arrow pointing from it
towards you, that's the direction it's about to quickly move in whilst still
spinning. It'll do that a couple of times before collapsing to take a break.
Once he's gone another two will join and then after them another one and two
Coldspears before the gate opens up. Before going through it instead smash
through the crates on the left side and go up the steps behind them.

At the top on the left side beneath some more crates is [Lost Mittens 1/4],
it's just to the left of a Fire Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | The Flame Steppes (Fire)                                                  |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Turn the wheel to bring up a series of floating platforms, they'll        |
 | quickly vanish again so start jumping across. While you're doing that     |
 | look for the three keys floating in the air, there's one towards the      |
 | front, towards the back on the right and then one at the back on the      |
 | left. While you will lose the keys if you fall down you can instead make  |
 | your way to the gate with only one or two of them and unlock as many of   |
 | the locks as you've got keys before trying to get the other keys, the     |
 | locks won't relock if you fall. Opening the gate will get you [Legendary  |
 | Treasure 1/2 - Expensive Souvenir].                                       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go back down and through the monster gate to where Duff is waiting for you. Go
over to one of the catapults and get ready to play a little mini-game. Pull
back on the catapult and let the snowball go at about half power, too much and
it'll go right over the Blizzard Baller, too little and it'll fall short. Keep
doing the same power shots until it moves backwards, you'll then need to pull
even further to hit it. Don't go onto the rainbow rails just yet.

On the left side of the area by the stables is a weird looking animal, a
Snowroller, that you can jump on and bounce onto the roof. At the far end of
the roof is [Treasure Chest 1/4]. Now you can go to the rainbow rails, it's
that purple glowing light at the far end of the area.

   ,----------------------------------------,
  | [021103]      Aurora Rails      [021103] |
   '----------------------------------------'

It's a rail grinding segment, for the first part it's simple, just let yourself
grind until you get past a series of snowmen, one of whom will join you, the
rails will then split into three with mines in the way. Move left and right to
avoid them until you get near another of those Blizzard Ballers, press the
attack button to fire the snowman at the Blizzard Baller three times.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021104]      The Frozen Curtain (Water)      [021104] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

After landing head into the house on the left.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021105]      The Snow Shovel In the Stone      [021105] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

Talk to the Guardian of the Snowshovel and then pull the shovel out of the ice,
head outside and start digging through the snow piles. The key's in the middle
one on the right but you'll also want to dig through the left side to get to a
path behind them. It leads to a Speed Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Wind Whipped (Speed)                                                      |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | On the upwards ramp sections you'll be faced with frozen mines rolling at |
 | you, you've got to quickly move out of the way pretty much as soon as you |
 | see them in the distance and to make sure not to go boosting into them.   |
 | The reward for reaching the end is [Hat 1/2 - Crown of Frost].            |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

On the left of the Swap Zone is a door to go into.

   ,----------------------------------------,
  | [021106]      Hidden Vault      [021106] |
   '----------------------------------------'

And in the middle of the room is a Spark Lock, "Choose Your Path". As long as
you follow where the arrows are pointing you should be able to work out exactly
where you'll end up. With Shock take the left side down and it'll take you to
the blue lightning bolt. Now go left off the centre to get down to the bottom
and then right along to the very centre. Now with Bolt take the right side to
get to the green lightning bolt and then right off the middle before going to
the very centre and meeting up with Shock. That's [Treasure Chest 2/4].

Go back up to the area where you were digging and pick up the key (from the
piles on the right) to open the gate and head up the steps. At the top is a
pair of Evilized Snowrollers. These roll towards you and bash into a wall to
knock themselves out, when they do that they fire out a projectile aimed at you
so move out of the way of that. Attack them while they're stunned. They'll get
up after a while knocking you back if you're next to them (no damage though)
and then start rolling again. Once both and freed go through the monster gate
that opens.

Go down to the right past a giant block of ice to a Teleport Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Flash Frost (Teleport)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | There's some permanent gaps in the layouts of the sections and you'll     |
 | find yourself having to quickly cross over burners more often to get to   |
 | the Magic Runes. Once you get all nine you get [Legendary Treasure 2/2 -  |
 | Elven Arrow].                                                             |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

There are some horns down here that you can blow to get a few coins. Go back up
the slope and push the block on the left away to let the light beam melt the
ice. Then push it back into place and to the left so you can use it to get up
to the building.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [021107]      The Secret Keep      [021107] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

A little oddly empty but there's a [Treasure Chest 3/4] over on the right. Go
back outside.

Now turn the wheel four times to rotate the light beam and melt the ice block
on the right, that'll free a key which you can use to unlock the gate here. Go
up the slope and attack the enemies at the top before going left to an Undead
Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Awestruck Orbits (Undead)                                                 |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The task in here is to use the shovel and dig up the five Snowrollers     |
 | that have been buried in the snow. The first one is at the start next to  |
 | the Frost Elf. Now jump onto the platform moving past on the left side to |
 | get across to another platform, at the top is a pile of snow with the     |
 | second Snowroller in. Jump to the platforms floating past up here on the  |
 | right to get to the platform with a bridge ahead. The third one is at the |
 | back there behind another pile of snow.                                   |
 |                                                                           |
 | From where you jumped on go to the right across two moving platforms, dig |
 | out the back pile to get the fourth Snowroller. Now jump down to the      |
 | right and on the right side of that platform is the fifth and final       |
 | Snowroller. Once you free it you get given a [Winged Sapphire].           |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Ignore the pile of snow out here for the moment, you'll get a shovel for it in
a bit (and no not the one from the Undead zone), go up the stepped platforms to
the right to get a look at the furnace. At the top turn the wheel twice to melt
the ice covering a shovel, pick it up and head back down the steps to clear the
snow below, there's a Snowroller bounce pad underneath it which will let you
grab [Lost Mittens 2/4] in the air above.

Go back up and turn the wheel another three times to melt the other ice block.
Now push the stone block left and then down to where the ice block was, use it
to jump up to the top of the platform and dig out a key. Clear the snow off the
lock below and then use the key to open it.

If you want to use the Seeker Scope go up the right path and dig up the snow
blocking it, the treasure is in the Geargolem in the middle of the icy furnace.
Down the slope to the left is a new set of Chompies, called Chompy Blitzbloom,
as the running shoes imply they move and attack really quite fast so should be
attacked as quickly as possible. More will rapidly spawn in so keep on
attacking until the monster gate opens.

Up the slope and into another Chompy fight, this time backed up by a couple of
Sleetthrowers on platforms at the back. Kill them all and advance up the slope
behind them. Push the block to the left and then use it to jump up the left
side of the area, pushing the light crystal off the edge at the top. Instead of
jumping down to where you just pushed it instead go through the gap in the
railing at the back up here, you'll drop down the back next to a wheel, turn it
and then go up the platforms it creates to reach [Soul Gem 1/2 - Stink Bomb].

Now you can jump straight down onto the platform you freed from the ice and
onto the start of the next rainbow rail section.

   ,------------------------------------------------,
  | [021108]      Northern Light Rails      [021108] |
   '------------------------------------------------'

Loads of stationary rocks to jump over or dodge around all the way to the end
of the rails.

   ,-----------------------------------------,
  | [021109]      Frost Furnace      [021109] |
   '-----------------------------------------'

An Ice Geargolem. These fire out three icicles in a small arc in front of them,
they'll pause briefly to fire them but otherwise they'll just take a second or
two before they fire another burst towards you. So dodge out of the way and
start attacking. After a little you'll also be attacked by some of those fast
Chompies so take them out and then focus back on the Geargolem.

Once the Geargolem is defeated start jumping up and down on the red circle of
the bellows to stoke the furnace again and melt the ice. Pick up the Seeker
Scope treasure and head right out of the furnace room to Duff. Checkpoint!

Go past the Power Pod and interact with the two Snowmen standing by the sides,
continue down the path to the catapult at the bottom and start firing at the
Blizzard Baller as it circles around. With it destroyed pick up the key that's
appeared and go open the gate next to the Power Pod.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [021110]      Hibernal Harbor      [021110] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

Defeat the two Twistpicks and the Geargolem before going to the right and
picking up [Lost Mittens 3/4]. On the left side is a Dual Air and Life Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Sky Meadows (Air)                                                         |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This section is just all jumping to the right between balloons, bounce    |
 | pads and bouncy mushrooms. At the end is [Hat 2/2 - Ski Cap] as well as a |
 | mushroom teleporter that's really too close.                              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go straight on past a Giant chest towards the enemies, kill the Geargolem and
his Coldspear pal, then a little further to take out the Sleetthrower by Duff.
That'll open up a nearby boat to go onto, take out the three Twistpicks and
then interact with the two Snowmen to get them to head back towards the
catapult. Go over to it and shoot down the two Blizzard Ballers (though
stangely it only counts as one for the objective).

Pick up the key and unlock the gate up to the left.

   ,-----------------------------------------,
  | [021111]      Diamond Docks      [021111] |
   '-----------------------------------------'

Push the block to the right to let the light beam melt the first ice block.
Next push the block down so that it's in the bottom right corner and then push
the light beam against it so that it melts the second ice block. Push the block
up and then left before pushing the light beam to the right to melt the last of
the ice.

Jump up the platforms to get to a fight with an Evilized Snowroller and two
Sleetthrowers. Get rid of them as well as the Chompies, Coldspears and
Twistpick that appear before the monster gate opens.

First push the light crystal left, then push both blocks against the far side
and then one of them into the middle of the back. Now you can push the light
crystal onto the turntable in the very middle. Turn the wheel twice to melt the
ice on the right and free one Snowman. At the right end of the section you open
up are some platforms moving around, jump over to them and make your way right
to [Soul Gem 2/2 - Rubble Rouser].

Turn the wheel three times to free the second Snowman but then turn it again to
melt another block and then again to melt one more. Go up the ramp behind where
the ice was to get [Lost Mittens 4/4]. There are some steps here too that lead
up to a building.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [021112]      Kaleidoscopic Kiln      [021112] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

Talk with the Frost Elf to learn what to do. You've got to create six different
colours through the bellows. First jump on the left one to light the red lamp.
Jump on it again to switch off the flame. Hit the middle one for yellow, again
switch it off. Then the right one for blue. Keep that on and hit the middle
yellow bellows to have blue+yellow make green. Switch off the yellow and hit
the left one for blue+red make purple. Now hit the yellow one again to turn it
on before turning off the blue one and you've got red+yellow make orange. With
all six colours lit [Treasure Chest 4/4] will appear next to the Frost Elf.

Leave the building and go use the catapult to take down the three Blizzard
Ballers that are flying about, for the far one you've got to aim where it will
be when the snowball gets to it rather than where it currently is. Once that's
done jump on the last rainbow rail.

You'll eventually circle the Illuminator platform where you can see several
enemies, fire the Snowmen at them as you pass by and you'll drop off the rail
once they're all gone. After dropping off the rail go up the slope to the
central area.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [021113]      PrismTower (Earth)      [021113] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

This fight sees you battle each door of enemies one at a time. The first door
just has a couple of Coldspears and a Twistpick in it. The second has a load of
Chompies and an Evilized Snowroller to defeat. Third has the same as the first
but with an added Sleetthrower and the final door is about the same but with an
Ice Geargolem.

Just one thing to do before speaking with Sharpfin, behind him at the Airdocks
is now a present, you'll find [Bonus Mission Map - Sweet Blizzard] inside it.

Jump down to a slope on the right, follow it towards the camera and then across
some spinning platforms to [Balloon Animal 1/5].  Get back up and wander past
Flynn and Sharpfin down a slope to a purple coloured pond, use the floating
bits of ice to cross over it and meet a Cyclops Brawlbuckler. These are the
larger enemy type that has a shield, nothing all that special about their smash
attack.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021201]      Typhoon Trail (Earth)      [021201] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

You'll reach a thin frozen river, drop off the right side of it down to a door
in the wall. That'll take you over to some stepped platforms that lead up past
a couple of Gazermages to [Soul Gem 1/2 - Fryno]. You can jump off the ledge
here to get back to the path at the purple pond.

This time go past the frozen river and through the windy faces, the first one
is blowing away from it and the other is sucking towards it. Not a hazard right
now but further on they'll become more of a nuisance. Take out the Coldspears
and the Gazermage before talking to the yeti Fizzy at the end. Activate and
then spin the lantern to open up the gate to the village below.

   ,--------------------------------------,
  | [021202]      Hooplaberg      [021202] |
   '--------------------------------------'

Talk to the yeti, Bozker, on the right side of the village next to the dog,
he'll ask you to win a chew toy. The doors of the buildings in the village will
suddenly open up and let you inside.

   ,-----------------------------------------,
  | [021203]      Filbop's Fete      [021203] |
   '-----------------------------------------'

To the right of Bozker is this house with an apple bobbing mini-game. Bobbing
for Apples is done by running around the area picking up the apples while
avoiding the mines. If you look carefully you'll notice that just before the
mines and apple appear there's a slight frothing of the water, watch out for
this as standing on a mine when it appears is not going to be good for your
health (although eating an apple will heal you). Plenty of time to get the ten
you need to win your first chew toy. Take it outside and Wibbles will dig up
some coins for you.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [021204]      NikNak's Hobnob      [021204] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

A memory game in the building to the left of Bozker. Three symbols will apper
over the fireplace and you have to turn the three devices so that they match
the symbols given. Not too difficult unless your memory is quite bad. You can
retry by talking to Puzzles again and get a different code if you weren't
paying attention. Outside to give the chew toy over and get some more coins.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [021205]      Brikabrack's Bash      [021205] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

In the building next to NikNak's Hobnob is a Shell Game, you've got to try to
keep track of which cup the chew toy is under and then pick that cup. Just keep
an eye on that one cup as it slowly gets moved around to win. Take the chew toy
outside to have Wibbles dig up [Treasure Chest 1/7].

   ,----------------------------------------,
  | [021206]      Num Num Hall      [021206] |
   '----------------------------------------'

On the left side of the village is another building to go into, at the back is
a chest with a Spark Lock, "Fan-Dango", on it. Switch to Bolt and press the
green button to switch the fans to blowing horizontally, switch back to Shock
and slide towards the fans where you'll get trapped bouncing between them.
Using Bolt step off the button and then back on as Shock is headed towards the
right side of the area, that'll push him down onto the orange button at the
bottom. Still using Bolt step onto the lowered orange platform and then use
Shock to press the orange button again to raise it. Move Bolt left onto the
lone platform and have Shock press the button again to lower the orange
platform and then go past it to get the blue bolt (pressing the green button as
you go). Switch back to Bolt and go up to the fans, have Shock press it again
to make Bolt go down to the left to grab the green lightning bolt. Shock press
the button again and Bolt gets trapped, press again to bring him down to the
bottom onto the orange button so that you can now bring the two together to
open up [Treasure Chest 2/7].

Out in the village again just to the right of the locked gate is a [Balloon
Animal 2/5] on the table. Now time to solve another Spark Lock, "Near Miss".
This one is about timing, have Shock go down as the blue lightning bolt starts
to move upwards over the left slippery path, that should time it so that you
hit the bolt. Now using Bolt do the same thing but with the green lightning
bolt headed right over the top path. To join them together you need to switch
back to Shock and slide upwards as Bolt starts going back towards where he
started. If you miss just keep sending Bolt out and trying again. Go through
the door.

At the top of the wooden ramp you'll find a Sneak Swap Zone, and a few enemies
to attack.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 | If you want the first bonus gem then continue to ride the moving platform |
 | all the way to the left through the second camera, it's just down a small |
 | slope behind some lasers. Ride the platform to the door to open.          |
 |                                                                           |
 | The second bonus gem is found by taking the platform going to the right,  |
 | it's behind a load of lasers. Once you've got it ride the platforms to    |
 | the left and when the camera on the track is moving away from the handle  |
 | start turning it to open the door, you'll probably have to stealth again  |
 | before the platform comes back and you can go through it.                 |
 |                                                                           |
 | Go down the slope and right through a camera track to get to a moving     |
 | platform. The last bonus gem is a little trickier to get than the others, |
 | ride the platform to the right and onto the camera track, wait for it to  |
 | start going away from you towards the gem and then quickly follow it over |
 | the lasers, you'll either have to very carefully find a spot that's not   |
 | in the camera's view and not on the lasers to stealth if you don't want   |
 | to be detected but a brief moment of detection may be more helpful than   |
 | several seconds of laser attack (co-op makes this easy, just turn off the |
 | camera!). Get back to the moving platform and ride it along to another,   |
 | through a camera and another platform to reach the end where the reward   |
 | is [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - Yeti Teddy].                                 |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

After defeating the Coldspears, Gazermages and the Chompies smash through some
crates at the back on the left to go up a thin path to a trio of Gazermages
guarding [Treasure Chest 3/7].

Now down the right path to a flowing purple river covered with ice platforms,
instead of crossing directly jump along them to the right to get the [Balloon
Animal 3/5] in the air. Get to the wooden platform and reach a Power Pod, oddly
the checkpoint is a tiny bit further along, just up a ledge past the twirling
purple blades, but there's some other stuff to get to before doing that. On the
left is a Magic Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Enchanted Bivy (Magic)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Talk to Yuks and then jump into the turret. Here you'll want to shoot the |
 | balloons but not the mines, so try to only shoot once for each balloon    |
 | otherwise you're going to end up hitting a stray mine. The reward for     |
 | getting 50 is a [Winged Sapphire].                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Just past the Magic Gate is a Dig Swap Zone, watch out for the spinning purple
blades as you go.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Glacial Descent (Dig)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | There's loads of spikes coming out of the walls in here to watch out for. |
 | The reward for digging up all three crystals is [Hat 1/2 - Four Winds     |
 | Hat].                                                                     |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Jump up the ledge by the spinning blade to reach the checkpoint. Up past a
windy face to meet an Evilized Chillydog. Unlike other Evilized things they
don't charge at you, instead they dig up a giant snowball and throw that at you
before jumping to another spot to do the same again. They're entirely
vulnerable to attack almost the whole time (during the jump you can't hit them)
so as long as you watch for the snowballs they're straightforward to defeat.
With the first one defeated a new pair of them will pop up to fight you.

Before you go through the monster gate go to the left and carefully grab the
[Balloon Animal 4/5] from behind the spinning blades. Go through the monster
gate now to meet a new obstacle, these begin to explode when you get close so
walk towards it and then immediately back up out of the red circle around it to
let it detonate safely. Jump down the ledge and go left.

   ,--------------------------------------------,
  | [021208]      The Tempest Maze      [021208] |
   '--------------------------------------------'

Careful of all the exploding mines as you get buffeted about by the windy
faces, at the back behind them all you'll find [Story Scroll]. Go back through
the wind and take the path to the right now, there's an enemy attack at a split
in the path, you should see a couple of the Coldspears coming out from behind
the trees on the right, go back behind there to find a couple of windy faces
with Gazermages on top, trip the mines and go around to attack the mages.
That'll let you open up the [Treasure Chest 4/7] behind them.

Go back and take the main path up to a Brawlbuckler and a couple of Gazermages,
defeat them and pass by to a larger fight with a monster gate. Defeat the first
of the Coldspears to trigger a couple of Chillydogs to join and then yet more
Coldspears. Go through the monster gate and follow the path down past a windy
face to another split. Take the left path into another fight to unlock
[Treasure Chest 5/7].

Head right to a Chompy Pod and a Gazermage before going past a few mines to a
bend in the path where more enemies will run in. Defeat the Coldspears, the
Chompies and the Brawlbuckler and head forwards to yet more enemies, you can go
past the Brawlbuckler to get up to the Gazermages on the hill. Next to them is
a small gap in the fence which you can drop down through to get onto the other
side of the trees of the path you just went along. Follow this to the right a
short distance to pick up the last [Balloon Animal 5/5].

Drop down and go back up the path and then up the wooden ramp next to the
closed gate, it'll lead to another lantern to turn on. Before going down into
the village you should go into the Dual Tech and Fire Gate on your left up
here.

 | An all out battle here, attack the Gazermages up on their roosts as well  |
 | as the three Brawlbucklers running about to open up the monster gate at   |
 | the back and collect [Legendary Treasure 2/2 - Endless Cocoa Cup].        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Now off down into the village.

Another yeti village.

   ,--------------------------------------------,
  | [021210]      Gratis Geld Haus      [021210] |
   '--------------------------------------------'

For some free gold go into the house on the right side of the village, there's
a Giant chest in here.

Talk to the kid on the table in the village outside to begin a quick quest to
collect some yeti teddies.

   ,------------------------------------------,
  | [021211]      Griznak's Gala      [021211] |
   '------------------------------------------'

The left building has a variation on the apple bobbing game, the variation
being needing to collect 20 apples. You'll get a few coins for giving the teddy
to Klizzy.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [021212]      Howzit's Hootinanny      [021212] |

Another memory game, this time with four icons to remember. Put them in in
order to earn your second yeti teddy.

   ,--------------------------------------------,
  | [021213]      Shorty's Shindig      [021213] |
   '--------------------------------------------'

And another shell game, this time it's much much faster so it'll be a lot
harder to keep your eye on the cup. If in doubt just guess.

Delivering the third yeti teddy will reward you with [Treasure Chest 6/7]. To
leave the village you'll need to solve a Spark Lock, "Circuit Breaker". There's
a ticking noise which is just the fan at the bottom switching on and off.
Switch to Bolt and slide down the right side to go through the fan when it's
off, you'll want to move just as the fan switches off. Press the orange button
to lower the platform above you and turn the fan to the left on. Get the green
lightning bolt and then slide up to the top middle. Switch back to Shock and go
down to the left, with the fan on it should take you towards the middle where
you can slide upwards to get to the blue lightning bolt and Bolt.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021214]      Typhoon Trail (Earth)      [021214] |

Just outside the door is a pair of Brawlbucklers and a Chompy Pod to defeat,
after those are gone start crossing the river to your right.

  | [021215]      IceBreak Atolls (Water)      [021215] |

If you go directly across you'll get to an Air Gate.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Go right, avoiding the fans and up a vertical fan to the next layer. Go   |
 | left, and use the second fan to get across over the ledge, jump up into   |
 | the air being blown from it to be thrown over. The next layer has a       |
 | moving platform which you need to cross over quickly otherwise you'll be  |
 | knocked off, it's then followed by a more segmented similar situation but |
 | you'll want to jump over the first gap rather than wait for the other two |
 | to come in. Go up again and ride the first fan, the second one however    |
 | will need timing to land on the moving platform, not very precise timing, |
 | if the platform's there you should get to it quickly enough. Open the     |
 | present for [Hat 2/2 - Beacon Hat].                                       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Jump back onto the ice blocks and ride them to the left, don't just sit on one
though as it'll quickly disintegrate and you'll fall into the water. Aside from
the Gazermages along the edges there's nothing special to do other than get to
the end. Jump off onto the wooden platform and attack the single Gazermage
standing in the middle, watch out for the blades as a horde of Chompies attack.

  | [021216]      Perilous Precipice (Undead)      [021216] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

Just to the right of the monster gate is a gap in the trees, go through it down
to a platform below. Follow this along up a series of spinning platforms, keep
doubling back to avoid the mine explosions, all the way to the top and [Soul
Gem 2/2 - Trap Shadow]. With that picked up go back down the platforms and up
through the monster gate.

Cross the bridge over where you just found the Soul Gem and defeat the Chompy
Pod blocking you way, time to start jumping over a couple of spinning blades to
reach a Bounce Swap Zone on the right.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Frosty Frolicking (Bounce)                                                |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The key difference here is the gusts of wind that you'll find partway     |
 | through each section, jump into them to be bounced further upwards. You   |
 | get [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Frigid Fright] for reaching the third        |
 | balloon.                                                                  |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go left, watching out for that blade, up the wooden path and off to the left at
the curve to find [Treasure Chest 7/7]. Get back onto the path and defeat the
small number of enemies at the end before going right through a mine, then some
more enemies including a Brawlbuckler before reaching the final fight of the
level at the top. Defeat the Gazermages and then the two Brawlbucklers at the
back to cause another set of enemies to climb on in. After taking out those
Coldspears you'll be joined by a couple of Evilized Chillydogs to finish it
off. Light the lantern and you're done.

 '--------'               '------------------------'                '--------'

   1. Defeat Mesmeralda
   2. No Skylanders Defeated
   3. No Damage Taken

Get out of the way of the chorus members as they zip back and forth across the
stage, their attack is a bit wider than the lines so you'll have to be quite a
bit away from the lines to avoid damage. You can stay in the same horizontal
position once you've worked out a safe part but will need to move back and
forth to avoid the horizontal lines. After a bit they'll stop and two
spotlights will appear on the stage, switch them on to light up the red eyes of
Mesmeralda so that she comes down onto the floor. Attack while she's blinded by
the light and keep on attacking until she goes back up again.

During the next line segment you'll also be attacked by those proximity mines,
they can be triggered by damage here so if you've got a long range attack you
can get them to blow up without getting anywhere near close. After avoiding all
the lines hit each of the spotlights until you get Mesmeralda down again,
attack her while avoiding the mines that are still arriving.

The next part just adds that you get several mines at the same time, avoid them
and the chorus members until the four spotlights appear for you to switch on.
And attack her again.

Now you'll have to jump over the pink rotating blade that's spinning around the
room while still avoiding those lines although I just tend to stick to a corner
as the blades don't reach there. Watch where the spotlights hit as Mesmeralda
will move position if you take too long to hit the right one, which means the
right one may have just become one that you've already tried.

Same for the next part except with two blades spinning around, the corner
tactic still works just fine. The final stage adds back in all the mines and
keeps the two blades so it's going to get a bit hectic if you're standing in
the middle.

Go forwards and then to the right over a small set of wooden platforms towards
a fence that's burning with a purple flame. Don't get too close but note where
it is, go left over the stone bridge to meet Sprucie. He'll go over and stand
next to a fire hose, follow the hose to the left over a bridge to find another
type of Chompy, the Chompy Boomblossom. These little guys throw themselves at
you and then explode, you don't even need to damage them.

Interact and then open the fire hydrant at the end of the hose to start filling
up water balloons. If you go over to where Sprucie was you'll be able to pick
up a water balloon, you can throw these at the purple fires to put them out.
One that is optional is the fire over by the hydrant, if you take the balloon
over there and douse the fire you'll find a fishing pole that you can use. The
only reward for fishing the fish successfully is a few coins though.

Take another water balloon back towards the first fire that you saw over the
stone bridge and jump down onto a moving platform behind it, jump to the right
onto a small grassy platform and then over a couple more to reach [Soul Gem 1/3
- Blast Zone]. Don't worry about putting out the small fires here, there's
really no reason to. Instead go back up and use another water balloon to clear
the first just to the right of it.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [021402]      Troll Toll Bridge (Magic)      [021402] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Cross over the stone bridge and jump up the wooden platforms on the right and
then go left past a small fire to a trio of Cadet Crushers. Another one will
join in from the broken up bridge, once they're all defeated cross over that
bridge and defeat another pair of Crushers as well as some Chompies too. Up on
the right side at the end is a hydrant that you can turn to put out the fire
blocking the path.

Jump down the ledge next to Nolan following the coins, if you stay on this
first platform down you can jump to the left onto a floating green platform to
a second one with [Wooden Dalmatian 1/6] on it. Jump back to the right and
continue further down towards some more fires.

Attack the Crushers and Chompies down here before passing by the large fire and
smashing through a fence.

 | Not much different this time, just loads of fire platforms and blocking   |
 | platforms to get in your way. The reward is [Legendary Treasure 1/3 -     |
 | Topiary of Doom].                                                         |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up the ramp behind the pump and follow the hose into the cave.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021404]      Stoneyard Cave (Life)      [021404] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Keep following the hose to the back of the cave where a bunch of enemies will
attack, including an Undead Spell Punk. These raise up undead Cadet Crushers to
fight you, the Crushers don't give any experience for defeating them (but do
count towards the Enemy Goal) so it's not worthwhile to let the Spell Punk keep
sending them at you, instead attack the Spell Punk and ignore the Crushers as
they'll vanish with the Spell Punk. It's not totally harmless by itself as they
will sometimes fire out a skull at you that does some damage. Once it's gone go
over to the hydrant and switch the water on.

On your way back out you'll be ambushed by another Undead Spell Punk as well as
two living Crushers that aren't tied to it. Defeat them and go back out to the
pump. Take a water balloon and run as fast as you can to the left back along
the wooden bridge towards the fire underneath the broken bridge, you should
just be able to make it to where the prompt comes up to throw it, behind the
fence is [Wooden Dalmatian 2/6].

Take another water balloon but this time throw it at the burning fence next to
the cave entrance. Carefully go up the slope behind it and watch the fire
breathing device as it pumps up and breathes out fire, run past it just as the
fire stops to be safest. Jump along a series of platforms to get up to the top
of a small hill before dropping down off the edge to the right, if you carry on
a little further right you'll find [Wooden Dalmatian 3/6], go back a little and
then forwards to continue.

The Missile Mauler has a rocket attack that changes direction once so you'll
have to move out of the way once it's done that rather than immediately (unless
you're really close in which case you'll have to dodge twice as it'll come back
towards you). There are also a few Crushers that'll attack, and once you take
out the Mauler a second Mauler will appear slightly further up on the left. Be
careful of the barrels around here as they'll damage you if you're right next
to them when they explode.

On the left is a pump to clear out the fire and on the right side is a Tech
Gate.

 | Just like the previous teleporting tech zone you pick up the little white |
 | sphere and throw it where you want to teleport, in this first case that's |
 | over by the massive teleporting sphere ahead. Once you're inside take the |
 | ball from the post and throw it towards the bridge ahead, grab another    |
 | ball from the left and then go right avoiding the green glowing spike     |

 | Throw the ball over to a platform with a green spike coming out of the    |
 | ground, once you get there try not to bump into that spike as you jump up |
 | to the right to grab the next ball. Throw that over to a much larger gear |
 | platform with another spike in the middle, at the top of its movement     |
 | jump off the left side and along some platforms. Grab another ball and    |
 | throw it far in the distance to the right by a large turning gear, get    |
 | another ball from the right and throw it through the turning gear when    |
 | there's a gap to do so.                                                   |

 | Destroy the enemy shooting at you before grabbing the teleport ball on    |
 | the right and throwing it onto the gear moving up and down. On the left   |
 | is another ball to throw through a turning gear at the top of the         |
 | platform's movement. And that's the last one, use the giant teleporter to |
 | get back out and receive [Hat 1/1 - Flower Garland].                      |

If you haven't cleared it yet turn on the fire hydrant to get rid of the fire
and open up the path.

   '------------------------------------------------'

Make your way past another two of the fire blasters then up to a couple of
Missile Maulers and an Undead Spell Punk. With all of those defeated you'll
have a brief chat with Willowbark who'll ask you to jump into his ship, ignore
him for a moment instead going to the right side of the area past a couple of
small fires to a wooden platform sticking off the edge above the Tech zone with
[Treasure Chest 1/5] on it. With that out of the way jump onto the ship.

You can put out the little fires along the way to the first burning ship but
again they count for nothing. As you get to the first ship start putting out
each of the four fires along its side by aiming at them and holding down the
fire button. The ship will then move on to the next burning ship, between them
you'll also be able to shoot down some crates to get a few extra coins. The
second one has five fires and the third ship has eight, look all over the ship
right the way to the top of the sails. With those done you'll dock.

Go forwards along the path, take the right one as you get to a fork and you'll
reach a Spark Lock chest, "Help Me Help You". Switch to Bolt and move left to
hit the green button, switch back to Shock and go left along the moving
platforms and then over to the red button. That'll move the red platform so
that you can switch to Bolt and use it to get across and down to the purple
button. Have Shock press the red button again to bring the platform back and
then use it himself to reach his blue lightning bolt. Switch to Bolt and go and
stand on the lowered purple platform, switch back to Shock to press the purple
button and raise Bolt up. Now get Bolt to grab the green lightning bolt and
then jump down so that you can meet up with Shock and open [Treasure Chest
2/5].

Go up the left path avoiding the rolling barrels and go right at the top, now
follow a row of barrels down to the right towards a wooden bridge. Just to the
left of the bridge is a small path to go along next to the water, jump over the
platforms to reach [Story Scroll]. Reverse your path and go over the bridge.

Time to meet the Evilized Screecher. This flying enemy swoops down and drags a
line of damage along behind it, jump over the line and then wait for the owl to
hit a wall and be briefly knocked out. After freeing the first Screecher
another two will start attacking, get rid of them to be attacked by a couple of
Crushers and then a Mauler up on the ledge at the back. Jump up onto the ledge
to take it out and grab [Treasure Chest 3/5] up there behind him.

Through the monster gate on the right side is a Dual Undead and Life Gate.

 | Take out the Life Spell Punk first to stop if from healing the enemies    |

 | at the back to complete the area. The present at the back contains        |
 | [Legendary Treasure 2/3 - The Brass Tap].                                 |

watching out for the Missile Mauler firing rockets at you. Follow the hose to
the hydrant in the distance and turn it on. Take a water balloon over the water
and throw it at the first fire, then go back and grab a second water balloon to
throw at the second fire behind it. Behind that second fire is [Wooden
Dalmatian 4/6]. Jump to the right past a fire blaster and past the exit out of
the cave, instead keep on going right over a wooden platform to [Treasure Chest

getting hurt (or if you've got a rapid long range attack you can just shoot
them out of the way) to the top and stop at the fire, don't go into the open
area just yet. On the right side are some steps in the grass to jump up and
find [Treasure Chest 5/5] as well as, if you go a little past the barrel
dispenser, a hydrant to turn on. That'll get rid of the fire blockage and allow
you to reach [Wooden Dalmatian 5/6].

Now go through the area with the little stone wall around it. A Tech Geargolem
will appear (you may have actually met one earlier in the level) and start
firing rapidly at you, move out of the way and attack it like any other
Geargolem, circling around it while attacking. Watch out for the Chompies and
Crushers that are also attacking as they can be quite dangerous.

With them all dead you can go through the monster gate at the back. Jump over
the platforms to reach a Rocket Swap Zone.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | As you might expect the fires lining the route are a little dangerous to  |
 | get close to, so weave your way through them and make your way to the end |
 | to collect [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 - Chompy Sauce].                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Just before speaking to Willowbark again you can go to the side of the house to
open up a Giant chest. Jump on the ship again and start putting out fires. Your
priority is to stay alive so take out the trolls as quickly as you can,
remember that you can move the target quicker when you're not firing water.
With the three Missile Maulers down put out the fires on the rest of the
buildings to move to the next section. The second part of the village is much
the same but watch out down to the left as there's another Mauler just off
screen there.

Once you land jump down towards the Power Pod and the Checkpoint! Go into the
large open area.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [021410]      Birchberg (Undead)      [021410] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

Follow the hose into the cellar doorway at the far side of the town.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021411]      Birchberg Reservoir (Undead)      [021411] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

Immediately you'll be faced with a Tech Geargolem to destroy, circle around it
attacking until it collapses into a puddle of experience. Keep following the
hose towards the back of the cave over the wooden platforms. After turning the
hydrant on exit the cave via either exit and go up the right side following the
hose back towards the pump, down to the right of it is [Treasure Chest 5/5].

Take a water balloon into the doorway that the hose goes into and throw it at
the fire on the ramp on the left side of where the Geargolem was. Behind the
fence is [Wooden Dalmatian 6/6]. Go back outside again, watch out for the
exploding Chompies, and throw another water balloon at the fire on the left
side of the village that's blocking the exit.

Behind there is a set of enemies including two Evilized Screechers that'll fly
towards you so get ready to jump over their attacks. After getting rid of them
and the Crusher go to the left side of the area and stand on the wooden
platform so that you can jump to another wooden platform floating just off the
side. Go up the platforms (the jump's high but you can make it) and past a fire
blaster to reach [Soul Gem 2/3 - Freeze Blade].

Jump down and at the back is an Undead Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Shadow Path (Undead)                                                      |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | A kinda cool looking side-scrolling section now, keep going right over    |
 | the gaps and past the enemies before going down a large platform and      |
 | beginning to go left. Watch out for the glowing spikes coming out of the  |
 | ground and then after a tilting platform out of the ceiling as well. The  |
 | present is at the end by the giant skull, it's a [Winged Sapphire].       |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

If you haven't already turn on the hydrant by the Undead Gate to clear the fire
on the right side so you can go through. Jump over and move around the barrels
rolling down the hill as you get to the top you'll find a Sneak Swap Zone to
the left over a stone bridge.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The unique feature in this one is the platforms that only appear as you   |
 | get close. That generally means you're unsure about exactly where you're  |
 | going to be headed. Go down the slope to the left and the first few       |
 | platforms will appear, if you want the bonus gem then continue on the     |
 | platforms a bit further than the lasers and go to the right. That'll lead |
 | you around through some lasers until you reach the gem. Return to the     |
 | first part and go left over the lasers, through a camera and off to the   |
 | door.                                                                     |

 | Head to the right along the camera track and at the far end go along the  |
 | three lasers, using the platform in the middle to pause if you want.      |
 | Cross directly over the four lasers and then over the last two towards    |
 | the door handle, just before you get to it if you want the bonus gem go   |
 | off along the platforms that appear towards it. Open up the door and      |
 | return to the camera track to go through it.                              |
 |                                                                           |
 | Go down the track and off the right corner of the lasers, if you want the |
 | bonus gem then keep going left as you pass by the button. It's at the end |
 | of another camera track. Go push the button with [Legendary Treasure 3/3  |
 | - Glowy Mushroom] as the reward.                                          |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go straight on over the platforms, avoiding the fire blasters and then into a
fight with a Screecher, an Undead Spell Punk and a Mauler all attacking you.
Turn on the hydrant on the left side and then follow the hose along over a past
another fire blaster on the right. Take the water balloon and throw it at the
fire blocking the path at the left end.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [021412]      Forest Path (Water)      [021412] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

Over the bridge and down the platforms to get over to that Missile Mauler
that's firing at you. Once you've got rid of him go left past a fire blaster
and through a set of rolling barrels, if you go to the left through another
fire blaster partway up the hill you can get [Soul Gem 3/3 - Scratch] from some
platforms off to the left behind three fire blasters all in a line. They all go
off at the same time so you'll want to hustle through there quickly.

Get back to the barrel rolling hill and continue up it.

   ,----------------------------------------------------,
  | [021413]      Ancient Dig Site (Water)      [021413] |
   '----------------------------------------------------'

There's a couple of Tech Geargolems on either side as well as a Mauler sitting
in the middle to defeat, a few Crushers and Chompies will rush in to help once
you've taken down some of them. With the last Crusher defeated go turn the
hydrant on the left side on to clear the path up to the last ride in the ship
of the level.

Once again take out the two Missile Maulers standing next to the Ancient Tree
Spirit before clearing up the remaining fires. Now use the water to blast the
missiles being fired at you out of the air and then again to get rid of the
waves of enemy ships that start appearing. After a little Kaos will appear and
start firing rockets again, keep knocking them out of the air until he turns
his ship around, then fire the water at the purple fires of his engines.

More waves of enemies to take down before Kaos returns again, this time
there'll still be waves of enemies behind him as he attacks so make sure not to
miss any of the missiles even while attacking his engines again. He'll keep
coming back in until you've put out all of the fires on his ship and finished
the level.

cannon.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021501]      Liquid Goo Lab (Life)      [021501] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

The barrels in this level are safe to attack up close so don't worry about
getting hurt. Go down the ramp towards the green goo, use the platforms
floating in it to get across to another large goo container with a larger
single platform in the middle where you meet a Chompy Pastepetal, these
Chompies split in two when hit (the first one has already split into two) so
will take more than just the usual single hit to kill.

Jump over to the left where you'll see Softpaw pop out again by the locked
door. Go left and jump down onto one of the spinning arms to avoid landing in
the puddle of goo on this side, jump up off it to the left to see a K-Bot
Gloopgunner. Their attack is long ranged, you'll see a target circle, and if
you get hit by it or stand on it after it lands you'll get covered in green
goop and take damage over time. So, you know, don't get hit by it. On the left
side behind all the crates is [Treasure Chest 1/5], shake it open and then head
up the ramp to take out the enemies up there.

Again use one of the arms to get over to the middle of the rotating platform
and pick up the key, you can jump directly down to the first of the rotating
arms on your way back to the locked door where you spoke with Softpaw. Go down
the steps and then up off down onto a platform with some Chompies and a
Gloopgunner shooting down on you, go up the ramp to get him. Carry on forwards
and then up to the left to another Gloopgunner and some Chompy friends.

At the top go to the right to find a Speed Swap Zone.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Plenty of green goo obstacles to avoid in here, some bouncing up and      |
 | down, some moving side to side. You're going to have to watch out for the |
 | side to side ones as they'll often side swipe you as you're trying to get |
 | past. The reward is [Legendary Treasure 1/2 - Masterful Disguise].        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go to the left now.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021502]      Contraption Lab (Life)      [021502] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

The K-Bot Mineminer has several different attacks you'll need to watch out for.
First up is his triple rocket attack, run out of the way of the rockets to
avoid damage, it'll then teleport to another spot. Second is a spinning attack
which causes a straight line of energy to rotate around the room, jump over it
as it passes by. And a third attack is a slam down that causes a pulse of
energy to radiate from the Mineminer that you need to jump over. After each of
the energy attacks it'll also fire out some rockets before teleporting. Watch
the Mineminer closely to see which one it's going to do, for the rockets the
rockets will start sparking, for the line an electricity line will go down into
it, and for the slam it'll jump into the air.

Ignore Softpaw's surfboard and instead go stand on the left side near the
yellow water, a platform should float up out of it that you can jump on to
reach [Treasure Chest 2/5]. There's another spot over next to Softpaw that does
the same thing, stand by the water to bring up a platform and then jump up.

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [021503]      Top Secret Storage (Life)      [021503] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Watch out as you smash stuff in here as it's full of Chompies and there's a
Gloopgunner up the stairs on the right. Behind him is [Wool Sweater 1/4].

Now that you've got those you can go and ride on the surfboard.

   ,---------------------------------------------------,
  | [021504]      Sheep Inspection (Life)      [021504] |
   '---------------------------------------------------'

Immediately turn around and head towards the camera where [Treasure Chest 3/5]
is sitting. Now your task ahead is to avoid walking in the glowing red circles
underneath the eye-in-the-sky bots, if you do get caught in one you'll be taken
over to the pen on the left and have to try again. Make your way over to where
Softpaw is by waiting for the near spotlight to come close and then walking to
the left side of it straight over to Softpaw. Talk to him to get put into the
sheep disguise again.

With the costume on you're perfectly safe to walk in the spotlights, now go
through the spotlight back near the start that was completely covering the
stairs.

   ,-------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021505]      Experimental Storage (Life)      [021505] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

At the top you'll find [Soul Gem 1/2 - Punk Shock]. Go back down the steps.

Cross the area and go through the stationary spotlight on the right that was
otherwise blocking the path down to another red X to stand on.

   ,----------------------------------------------,
  | [021506]      Sheep Tower (Life)      [021506] |
   '----------------------------------------------'

Go down the right path through some crates where [Wool Sweater 2/4] is waiting.
Now up the left path to some Chompies, a couple of Gloopgunners will also
attack and then a Mineminer will appear and start on you too. With those all
gone the monster gate will open to let you through.

   ,------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021507]      Chompy's Last Stand (Life)      [021507] |
   '------------------------------------------------------'

Go to the balcony on the left side to get this area checked. Once you've done
that go over to Softpaw and get to solving the Spark Lock "Blowing in the
Wind". This is another one with fans alternating automatically. First use Shock
and go straight up to hit the green button without getting blow to the right.
That'll lower a platform and toggle a pair of green fans. Now ride the fan to
the right and wait on the green lightning. Switch to Bolt and ride the fan
below it to the right and then over the lowered green platform, go left to
where Shock started and switch back to Shock. Now go left and then down over
the green platform to where Bolt started, again switch back to Bolt. Go up and
press the green button to toggle the fans and raise the platform. Back to Shock
ride the bottom fan to the right and pick up the blue lightning bolt, wait by
the raised green platform. Get Bolt to hit the green button again and then ride
the fan to the right to grab the green lightning, then simply join up with
Shock over the lowered green platform.

Jump on the surfboard to get to the next area. Checkpoint!

   ,-----------------------------------------------------,
  | [021508]      Glob Lobber Gangway (Air)      [021508] |
   '-----------------------------------------------------'

Jump on the platform floating in the goop and the nozzle nearby will shoot out
a projectile, this happens every time you land on the platform so don't go
crazy jumping out of the way of them otherwise you'll just get overloaded with
them. Instead calmly walk out of the way of the single one that pops out. Jump
left onto solid walkway and go up to the Power Pod.

To the left of the Power Pod is a set of stairs, next to the stairs is a Giant
chest if you want to open that, head up the stairs to get up to the top and
some more floating platforms, jump over them and up to a row of them, these are
like the previous floaty platform but instead of plopping out a bit of goop
somewhere instead when you land on them it fires a ball out from the glowing
circles at the end, they're fully predictable so just land out of the way and
don't jump except to move to the next one.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021509]      Belly Flop Peak (Air)      [021509] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Round the end on a platform sticking out you'll find [Soul Gem 2/2 - Doom
Stone], you have to jump up to grab it. You can now just jump directly down to
the large floating platform below.

Jump to solid land and meet the K-Bot Splodeshard, these are just like the
spinning enemies you've seen a lot of in the game, avoid them when they're
attacking and attack them when they're resting. After taking them out go up the
left exit and then down onto the rotating platform below.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021510]      Chompie Churners (Air)      [021510] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Immediately go up the steps to the left of this first rotating platform to find
a bunch of crates and [Treasure Chest 4/5] hiding behind them. On the second
turning platform jump to the left along a broken series of small platforms.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021511]      Secret Testing Grounds (Air)      [021511] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

There's two more Splodeshards over here along with a Mineminer hiding in the
corner, with them dead the monster gate will open and allow you to get the
[Wool Sweater 3/4].

Go back to the turning platforms and go the the top right side where there's a
Bounce Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Kaotic Spring (Bounce)                                                    |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Surprisingly the floating yellow blobs are not ideal bouncing platforms,  |
 | instead they'll hurt you. Shocking. Sometimes you'll need to bounce in    |
 | place on a solid platform to wait for the blob to move and sometimes      |
 | you'll need to take a less direct route over the cracked platforms to get |
 | where you're wanting to safely. The last section has them really close    |
 | together so you'll have to use your shadow to make precise landings. The  |
 | reward at the end is [Bonus Mission Map 1/2 - Cursed Statues].            |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Back onto the rotating platform and this time go over to the floating platforms
to the north-west, jump over them to get to some enemies. Take out the
Chompies, the Splodeshard and the Gloopgunner. Go to the left along the
platform and then down onto a slightly rotating platform, walk over it to pick
up [Story Scroll] and then go along the path at the back to get to an Earth
Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Dumping Grounds (Earth)                                                   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The crates you're looking to smash are the big blue crates that take a    |
 | few hits to open. There's one on the first platform to the right and then |
 | the other two are up at the end. There are a few enemies hiding in there  |
 | too so watch out for those Splodeshards. Return the parts to get the      |
 | [Winged Sapphire]. Yeah, that's not a Geargolem.                          |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go back up and head up the steps on the right, there's a Magic Spell Punk.
These cause nearby enemies to become invisible, they can still attack you but
you can still see their attack effects so you should be able to avoid taking
damage. Once you've got rid of those three go left along the path to a rotating
platform that moves up and down, jump on as it's in the down position and ride
it around to the other side.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021512]      Sludge Security (Tech)      [021512] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Jump down the small staircase to a section with another rising platform, this
one's got enemies on it. Destroy the three Gloopgunners and the Chompies that
appear to open up the monster gate at the back.

Time for some more spotlight avoiding, the platforms here are also the variety
that create goop balls so watch out when jumping onto them. Follow one of the
spotlights around so you can reach where Softpaw is hiding on the other side.
When in the SHEEP disguise remember that while the spotlights will ignore you
you'll still be able to take damage from the goop balls. Go to the right to a
red X.

   ,-------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021513]      Flooded Containments (Tech)      [021513] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

Quickly start going up the steps as the yellow goo is going to start rising up,
it will go back down once it's reached its peak but there's nothing interesting
to go back for here. Instead carry on going and you'll find a Water Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Mystical Fountains (Water)                                                |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The task in here is to defeat Mister Chompy. He's a massive Chompy that   |
 | splits into two many times over before it's beaten, so just keep on       |
 | attacking the Chompies until they're all gone. Reward is [Hat 1/1 -       |
 | Asteroid Hat].                                                            |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up the steps and then down into the flooded room, wait for it to lower and
then go over to the far corner, kill the Gloopgunner sitting there and wait for
a chance to go over to the left corner and finish off the second one too. Go
through the exit to reach a Spark Lock, "Icebreaker".

First switch to Bolt and go down to the bottom before going straight back up
through the green lightning bolt. Now back to Shock go right and then up and
press the purple button, stay there and switch to Bolt. Have Bolt ride the
purple fan over to the blue button on the left, then go down and then to the
right into the middle of the puzzle. Switch back to Shock and turn off the
purple fan. Now go down and ride the blue fan to the right, use the top moving
platform to go to the left over to the blue button, from there go right towards
the purple fan and the blue lightning bolt. Immediately go straight back to the
blue button and then into the middle to meet Bolt. Time for a surf!

Up the steps to your left is [Treasure Chest 5/5] (if you don't want to fight
the Chompies then don't destroy the valves). Straight over from where you
landed is a Climb Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Tower of Falling Goo (Climb)                                              |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The new obstacle to avoid is fire bursts coming out of the sides at       |
 | certain points, there's no rush so just wait for them to die down before  |
 | moving past them. They don't quite stretch the entire way across so you   |
 | should be safe at the far end of one (but obviously if there's two        |
 | together that doesn't apply). The reward is [Bonus Mission Map 2/2 -      |
 | Undercover Greebles].                                                     |

Cross back over the floating platform and go up to the left.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [021514]      The Gauntlet (Tech)      [021514] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

As usual be careful when jumping on these floating platforms, they'll throw
goop balls at you. On the other side continue going to the left.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021515]      Goo Pit of Doom (Tech)      [021515] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Wait for the yellow goo to lower and then quickly go down the path and grab
[Wool Sweater 4/4] from the very bottom of the walkway. Once you've got it
quickly rush back up again to avoid the goo.

Go up the other steps.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021516]      Sheeplight Checkpoint (Tech)      [021516] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

At the top you'll find a Magic Spell Punk helping a Mineminer, destroy them and
the Chompies that come in before going up the steps and the back and going to
the right to a Dual Magic and Earth Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Goo Pond (Magic)                                                          |

 | win [Legendary Treasure 2/2 - Skylander Scope].                           |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Up to the left and defeat the Gloopgunner standing in the doorway as well as
the three Splodeshards that appear. Go through the monster gate and head to the
middle of the spotlights, careful of the rising and falling goo. Go to the
right to grab the key and use it to unlock the gate at the top. Through there
is Softpaw to give you the disguise again. Use it to go along the top left path
and onto another red X.

   ,--------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021517]      Super Duper Guardpost (Tech)      [021517] |
   '--------------------------------------------------------'

While fighting the two Splodeshards watch out for the goo balls being fired at
you from the vents in the wall at the top. After those two are defeated two
more will join as well as two Magic Spell Punks, and because there's two of
them they can actually turn each other invisible too. Once those are down
you'll get two Mineminers to destroy, with those down that's it. Go through the
monster gate to solve one last Spark Lock, "Ping-Pong".

Switch to Bolt and move right onto the orange button, that'll raise up the
platforms on the left and start a fan, Bolt will start an infinite loop along
the ice. Have Shock go left and then down onto the blue button to let Bolt
free, now move further down and drop onto the purple button, switch to Bolt to
stand on the purple platform before using Shock to raise it again. Have Shock
move up to keep out of the way as Bolt comes over the red moving platform to
get the green lightning bolt. Finally take Shock to the right to get his blue
lightning bolt before returning to meet up with Bolt. To finish the level climb
aboard the surfboard.

 '--------'             '-----------------------------'             '--------'

   1. Defeat Kaos' Mom
   2. No Skylanders Defeated
   3. No Damage Taken

To kick off the fight she throws an Evilized Boghog and an Evilized Kangarat at
you, move out of their way and focus on one at a time. Once those are gone a
pair of Evilized Sugarbats will appear, same procedure as usual but each one
you defeat will cause another to appear, with the second one dead you'll also
have another Boghog and a Kangarat too. A few more Sugarbats will replace
defeated Sugarbats so if you attack the other two creatures instead you'll end
up with less enemies on the field at once. After they're all finally gone you
have to take your Skylander off the portal. Put it back on again to carry on.

Move behind one of the green crystals while Kaos' Mom is firing her purple beam
to get her to hit the crystal. With that done follow her through into the next
room. This time we've got Evilized Screechers and an Evilized Chillydog to
contend with, the Screechers are the ones you want to keep an eye on as their
attacks are quite wide. A few enemies down and you'll get a pair of Evilized
Snowrollers joining, watch out for the projectile they fire out when they hit
the walls. You'll want to destroy the Life Spell Punk that appears first
otherwise you're just doing the same damage over and over. More Screechers will
replace the dead ones but the Snowrollers will stay gone. Once all are done
remove your Skylander from the portal again.

And again go behind a green crystal. The next hallway has a few green goo balls
being fired across it, weave between the gaps, at the end there's two being
fired directly at you that you'll have to dodge a little quicker. Go through
into the throne room to get to the main fight.

A few Evilized Greebles will jump in as well as a couple of Greeble
Blunderbusses, attack them while you avoid Bubba Greebs' ranged attacks at you,
the last of which is a stick of dynamite that you can throw back at him. I'd
recommend waiting until you've cleared out the Greebles on the floor before
throwing it back to him otherwise you won't get to do much damage safely when
he's down on the floor, perhaps try using the dynamite to throw at the Greebles
themselves rather than Bubba. Once Bubba Greebs hits the floor he'll send out a
pulse of energy that you have to jump over, but once you've done that you can
attack without fear of damage from him.

After around a third of his health has gone he'll throw in some spinning
Greebles who you can pretty much guide into hitting each other. Again focus on
getting rid of them before tackling Bubba Greebs with his dynamite. Same as
before, jump over the blast and attack him when he's down. With about a third
of his health left you'll get another new set of enemies all long range
attackers firing at you to make jumping a little more dangerous but still
essential. With them gone take down Bubba Greebs. And again with the taking off
the portal.

Keep away from the purple beam while you wait for Tessa to drop a large mirror
into the fight, then just duck behind the mirror to end it.

And off we go to fight Kaos, talk to Tessa, Flynn or Sharpfin to head to
Cloudbreak Core.

 '--------'             '-----------------------------'             '--------'

   1. Defeat Super Evil Kaos
   2. No Skylanders Defeated
   3. No Damage Taken

Kaos will slam his foot down onto the ledge, jump over the circle of energy
that comes out of it and then get to attacking his toes. After a while he'll
talk about making Skylanders go splat and then when he slams his foot down
he'll lift it up and slam it down a second time before leaving it there for you
to attack so don't jump straight at his foot anymore. With both feet clear of
crystals it's time to go into his mouth.

Attack the teeth, after a bit of damage he'll open his mouth and throw in a
Fire Geargolem and some Chompies to attack you. Deal with the Geargolem in the
usual manner and Kaos will slam his mouth shut again, jump over the energy and
then get back to attacking his teeth crystals. Every now and then he'll slam
his mouth and cause the two energy circles to radiate again, jump over them
each time and just keep on attacking the teeth.

A little more damage and he'll throw in an Ice Geargolem. Destroy it and attack
the teeth again. Again more damage to the teeth will bring in a Tech Geargolem
and even more Chompies. Wipe them out to carry on destroying the teeth. The
next enemy will be a pair of Geargolems, an Air one and a Tech one. I'd
recommend attacking the Tech one on the right first to get them both closer
together so you can more easily avoid both their attacks while circling around
them. That's the last enemies you'll fight in here, finish destroying the teeth
to move onto the next area.

First just avoid the miniature Evil Glumshanks as he drives around the circle,
no need to attack it or anything. Next up are some Grumblebum Thrashers as well
as a pair of Boom Bosses firing at you. Keep moving and attacking until they're
defeated and a trio of purple crystals crashes down into the arena. Attack the
crystals while avoiding the incoming rocket attacks from Kaos.

After that it'll be an attack by two Rip-rotors and a pair of Gazermages. With
those gone it's three more crystals to destroy while avoiding the airship
attacks. The next group of attackers are not much of a threat but do a tiny bit
of damage so you will want to hit them away and not let them crowd you. The
next crystal sequence has a little more dangerous enemies attacking, move back
away from the exploding mines as they detonate. Once this last set of three
crystals is destroyed you move on to the next section.

Run to the right, jump over the obstacles but don't go too fast, every time you
see him bring his hands closer together quickly stop moving and double back a
short distance, he'll begin firing a purple beam of energy that you now need to
jump over to avoid taking damage. Once you're over it keep on moving to the
right. After several of those you'll reach the cannon at the end, fire it to
defeat him and finish the story.

   '--------------------------------------'

Safely back at Woodburrow you've opened up a few new things to do. Wheellock
down by the Under Hollow entrance has Score Mode unlocked for you to try, in it
you go through each story mode level trying to get those most points you can.
Avril over to the left of the pool has the Time Attack mode, this time you're
racing through the story mode levels as quickly as you can. You don't actually
have to go talk to them, the modes are also unlocked in the level select menu
for you to use quickly.

You've also unlocked the Nightmare level of difficulty, select it from the
Options menu and you can play through each level with stronger enemies to
fight.

If you've already unlocked Nightmare and just completed the game with it you'll
find a present next to Flynn with your [Hat - Volcano Hat] inside.

 '--------'            '-------------------------------'            '--------'

This is an Adventure Pack that requires the location piece from the Tower of
Time Adventure Pack.

   1. Place the gears in the Town Center
   2. Find the gear in the Steam Works
   3. Find the gear in the Wind Works
   4. Find the gear in the Water Works
   5. Enter the Tower and defeat Cluck

   1. Tool Box 3
   2. No Skylander Defeated
   3. Enemy Goal 50

   1. Areas Discovered 9
   2. Treasure Chests 3
   3. Legendary Treasures 3
   4. Hats 2
   5. Bonus Mission Map 1
   6. Winged Sapphires 2
   7. Story Scroll 1

Approach the Timekeeper standing next to the Time Freeze Switch, hit the switch
at any time, once the Timekeeper has stopped interrupting you hit it again when
the boards are lined up so you can cross. That'll pause time and give you just
enough to get across before it unpauses.

   ,----------------------------------------,
  | [021801]      Times Circle      [021801] |
   '----------------------------------------'

There are three clockwork Cadet Crushers hanging out by another Time Switch in
the middle of the area, if you hit the switch that'll pause the enemies too so
you can freely attack them without worry about being hit by their hammers. It
will unpause after a little so just keep on pausing it again to take out all
three easily, just be careful when they're coming out of the freeze not to let
them hit you.

Go through the gate that the Timekeeper opens up for you on the other side of
the area. The Time Switch here needs a little more precision and timing to get
the boards aligned but if you're a little off you can probably still just jump
over the gaps. Approach the next Timekeeper over by a valve that you can turn
to toggle two platforms, jump onto the lowered one on the right after hitting
the valve to be raised up to the platform above where there's a key. Jump back
down and open the locked door.

   ,---------------------------------------,
  | [021802]      Steam Works      [021802] |
   '---------------------------------------'

Go to the right side of the area to find a Tech Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Rickard's Gear (Tech)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Use the Time Switch when the boards at the back are up and then hit the   |
 | valve behind them, quickly jump to the left onto the lowered piston and   |
 | wait for time to start up again and be lifted up. The next set of boards  |
 | requires you to jump onto them in normal time to hit the Time Switch on   |
 | them, jump off the far end to the valve.                                  |
 |                                                                           |
 | Hit the valve to raise up the platform to your right (you can ride it up  |
 | to get a few coins but it's not essential), pull the valve again and      |
 | quickly go back over to the left to stand on the now lowered piston (the  |
 | Time Switch in the middle can help). Up top you'll find a present with    |
 | [Hat 1/2 - Leprechaun Hat] inside. Stand on the large piston at the back  |
 | and throw yourself back towards the start of the zone.                    |
 |                                                                           |
 | Not quite done in here though, hit the Time Switch so that the boards at  |
 | the back are up and you can hit the valve in the middle of them, then go  |
 | to the right onto the lowered piston and ride that up to [Tool Box 1/3].  |
 | Now you can leave.                                                        |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Use the valve out here to get up to the key, no need to use the Time Switch for
that one. Jump down and hit the valve again but instead of racing straight to
the piston on the left first go to the Time Switch so that you have enough time
to reach the left piston and ride it up.

Through the locked gate now you'll encounter some more enemies including a
clockwork Boom Boss standing up on the platforms at the back. Remember to use
the Time Switch to get the advantage over them. A few more enemies will spawn
in before you're done fighting here. Go through the monster gate once it's
open.

Hit the valve and then the Time Switch and rush over to the piston over on the
right to get up to a building you can go inside. It's not an actual named place
but it does have [Legendary Treasure 1/3 - Waterfall Decanter] inside in a
present.

To the right of the building is a Dig Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Tick Tock Tunneling (Dig)                                                 |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This dig zone has giant rolling boulders to avoid, just be patient and    |
 | you'll have plenty of time to get past each one. I'd recommend going to   |
 | the right crystal first before heading to the left and up to the back.    |
 | The reward for getting all three is a [Winged Sapphire 1/2].              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Jump back down and go turn the valve before rushing to hit the Time Switch and
then jumping onto the piston on the left. The next Time Switch needs you to
match up the two sets of folding platforms so that they're all up at the same
time, go across them and then up around the tree to the nest where you'll find
the first gear. Jump into Flynn's balloon to ride it back to the town square.

Walk up the steps to the door and the gear will automatically go into place,
unfortunately you'll be attacked by some enemies including a new Time Spell
Punk. These can unfreeze time so you'll have to take them out before using a
Time Switch (it does pause for a short time though so it might still be
helpful), they've also got a nasty projectile attack that they'll fire at you
to avoid. Once you've got rid of it and the Crushers a Timekeeper will open
another door for you.

  | [021803]      Wind Works (Air)      [021803] |
   '--------------------------------------------'

Jump over the floating platforms to reach a block puzzle, there's a giant fan
blowing that'll push the block back where you pushed it from so quickly hit the
nearby Time Switch before it does that and use the steps on the right to get up
and over the block to the left.

Here you'll find another set of enemies with a Time Spell Punk helping them,
take it out and another will replace it but no more will replace that second
one so get time pausing after that to clear up the remaining enemies. Before
going through the monster gate go to the left side over a bridge to the [Story
Scroll], now you can go through the gate. On the left is a Spin Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Spinning Cogs (Spin)                                                      |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | The zone is fairly typical of spin zones except that the target is a bit  |
 | off centre, the edges are also a little heavily made up of the            |
 | destructible elements than usual so be careful, especially when trying to |
 | get the bonus gems. The reward for smashing the Kaos Statue is another    |
 | [Winged Sapphire 2/2].                                                    |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

To the right is a large windmill with platforms attached to a rope, jump on one
of the platforms and ride it up to solid ground on the right. There are a few
enemies up here although oddly no Time Switch. So destroy them and shake open
the [Treasure Chest 1/3] that's by the building. The next set of windmill
platforms up to the right is your destination now, either ride one all the way
down to the bottom or just jump straight from the top to land on a platform at
the bottom with [Legendary Treasure 2/3 - Volcano Party Pass]. Get back onto
the moving platforms and ride up to the top right.

Up top you'll find another block fan puzzle but first go left into the
building, kill the two Crushers and the Boom Boss to get the Giant chest and
then go up the steps and out through the back door at the top left. Out here
you'll find [Tool Box 2/3]. Back out to the block puzzle again.

Push the block left and get next to the Time Switch to wait for it to be blown
to the back right corner and then pull it and rush up the steps on the right to
get on top of the block and grab the key from the ledge. Push the block again
but this time stop time when it's in the back left corner, go up the left steps
to get onto the block and over to the locked gate.

Just a simple time pause you'll find behind it, pause it when the rotating
blades are out of the way and quickly move over the bridge to the checkpoint!

On the right is the Power Pod but on your left is an Air Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Windianapolis (Air)                                                       |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | More block puzzles ahoy! Push the block towards the fan and jump left to  |
 | hit the Time Switch quickly before it gets pushed back, then quickly over |
 | to the left side of the block and push it to the right. Still in the time |
 | pause run up the ramp next to where the block now is and jump onto the    |
 | block to ride it across the gap and at the last moment jump off onto a    |
 | bounce pad (if you miss this another block will appear shortly to try     |
 | again).                                                                   |
 |                                                                           |
 | Push the next block forwards and then to the left, hit the Time Switch as |
 | it moves to the back left corner and quickly jump up the steps on the     |
 | left side to get up onto the block. It'll get pushed to the right where   |
 | you can quickly jump off and shake open the [Bonus Mission Map 1/1 -      |
 | Serpent Attack].                                                          |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go straight on over the floating platform to encounter a Clock Geargolem. This
large enemy is constantly spinning and cannot take damage until you pause time,
then it stops spinning and can take damage. So get past it and jump up the
platforms at the back to hit the Time Switch behind the Boom Boss. There's no
spell punk here so it shouldn't be too much trouble.

As soon as you hit the Time Switch in the next section a Time Spell Punk will
appear up on the platform at the back, you're going to want to push the block
left and then stand on the slightly raised platform in the middle waiting for
the block to almost align with the Spell Punk's platform and then hit the Time
Switch, very quickly jump on it and over to the Spell Punk before it gets the
chance to unfreeze time. Destroy the Spell Punk and the puzzle becomes
solvable. Push the block to the back right corner, freeze time and jump up the
steps on the right to get over the block.

Now just head up the tree to get the second gear. In the fight with Cluck you
can use the Time Switch to increase the amount of time he's on the ground but
you can still just do it all in regular time if you like but it's a lot quicker
to pause time, just make sure to jump over the energy blasts each time he
lands. After a while he'll start smashing down three times before stopping. And
then he'll disappear entirely and bring in a few regular enemies for you to
attack - watch out for Cluck's attacks from above though as they will keep
coming even during time freezes. With those gone Cluck'll start smashing down
again. Before his health runs out he'll retreat and end the fight.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [021804]      Water Works (Water)      [021804] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

Jump over the lilypads to get to the Water Works. Up a bounce pad to the left
is a Dual Life and Water Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Clock Springs (Life)                                                      |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Follow the bounce pads up, keep moving in the air to land on the smaller  |
 | platforms until you get to some enemies. At the back on the right is      |
 | [Treasure Chest 2/3], use the bounce pad to get up to the monster gate    |
 | once you've cleared out the enemies on the lower level and then up some   |
 | more bounce pads. At the end you'll find [Hat 2/2 - Beanie] and another   |
 | large bounce pad to get out of here.                                      |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Bounce over to a water block puzzle. Here you turn the blue wheel to cause the
water jets to toggle and push the floating block to the opposite side, what you
want to do is hit the Time Switch and jump onto the block to ride it to the
right side when time unpauses and jump up to get the key at the top. Jump down
and turn the wheel again but this time pause it so that you can jump straight
up to the locked gate.

Over another bounce pad you'll get to a fight. This one has a clockwork version
of the Loose Cannon type of enemy. The Time Switch in the middle should be
helpful but note that you cannot use the bounce pad at the back during a time
pause so you'll have to attack the Boom Boss up there in normal time. Once
they're all gone some lilypads will appear to let you move on.

   ,-------------------------------------------,
  | [021805]      Mount Clockmore      [021805] |
   '-------------------------------------------'

Attack the two Crushers and then go left to a Climb Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Windy Tower (Climb)                                                       |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This climbing zone features fans that'll push you to the side, if there's |
 | a rotating saw blade there you'll want to rush past the fan at the other  |
 | end to reduce the chance of getting pushed into it. Get to the top and    |
 | you get [Legendary Treasure 3/3 - Epic Soap of Froth].                    |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Bounce up from where you fought those two Crushers to a building you can go
inside. In there is [Treasure Chest 3/3]. Go back out and then bounce over to
another water block puzzle.

No need to hit anything yet, just jump onto the first block as it goes past and
then grab the key from the top platform. Jump back to the wheel to turn it,
wait for the block to fully go to the bottom end and then turn it again trying
to match the movement of the moving block, press the Time Switch to pause it so
you can jump onto the second block and then wait for time to unfreeze so you
can get [Tool Box 3/3] from the platform next to where you just got the key.
It'll bounce you back to the middle, return to the wheel and this time pause it
so that you can reach the gate on the right.

Time for a fight with a Clock Geargolem but also a Time Spell Punk. Get around
the Geargolem and use the bounce pad at the back to get up to the Spell Punk. A
Loose Cannon will also appear once you get up there but just focus on the Spell
Punk so that you can begin pausing time again. With the Geargolem dead you'll
be able to bounce out of here.

Another water block puzzle awaits. Turn the wheel once and then hit the Time
Switch to cause a Time Spell Punk to appear, you'll be able to jump straight
over to it to destroy it. Get back and turn the wheel again, pause time just as
it passes the end to jump onto it and ride it over to the key when it unpauses.
Bounce pad back and turn the wheel twice and pause it at the same point to get
over to the locked gate.

Time for another fight. No Spell Punks here right now so destroy the Loose
Cannon and the Crushers before bouncing up to the right to kill the Boom Boss.
That'll bring in some more enemies, stay up there to defeat the next Boom Boss
before crossing over to the opposite side and killing the Spell Punk. Now you
should be okay to destroy the Clock Geargolem that's appeared.

Bounce over to the tree and ascend it to get the third gear.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021806]      Tower of Time (Magic)      [021806] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Go into the tower, up the stairs and onto the large circular elevator, go to
the middle of it and wait to reach the first stop of the tower. Take out the
two Time Spell Punks and then go off the side of the elevator to hit the Time
Switch and defeat the large Clock Geargolem. Once all the enemies are dead the
lift will keep on going up.

Leave the lift and go up the steps to get to the fight with Cluck. Same sort of
thing as the last fight with him except that now you have to be in frozen time
to hit him, he's invulnerable during regular time. After about a quarter of his
health is gone he'll move on to the triple slam part but he'll also bring in a
Time Spell Punk so you'll want to defeat that before setting about pausing time
to attack Cluck himself. At about half health another Time Spell Punk will join
in so take that down too.

With about a third of his health left a pair of Time Spell Punks will be added
and Cluck will start a new attack after each recovery, he'll fire out a
straight line beam of energy from his face onto the ground. Avoid it if you
can. At about a quarter health yet another pair of Spell Punks will appear and
Cluck will begin firing out projectiles after recovering but he'll still
alternate between that and the more deadly energy beam. Watch out for any stray
blasts as you finish him off to complete the Adventure Pack.

Go along the middle path up the stepped slope and a sheep will demonstrate one
of the level's unique features. Anywhere you see a glowing vortex you can step
into it and be teleported a short distance away, like over a gap in this
instance. Jump into it to be taken over there.

Keep on going left and a couple of cyclops enemies will jump out of the ground,
these two are just the regular enemies that run up to you and start jabbing the
air rapidly, move out of the way of that and they're fairly harmless. After
taking them out jump down to the left and start pushing the block so that it
fills the gap next to the vortex. Before you go back up go further to the left
and open up [Treasure Chest 1/3].

Using the vortex to get up to the platform above the chest you'll fight another
pair of enemies, one the same as before and a ranged enemy that throws
jellyfish into the air at you. After killing them go up the wooden ramp behind
them.

   ,-------------------------------------------------------,
  | [021902]      Blind Beard's Ship (Undead)      [021902] |
   '-------------------------------------------------------'

Push the block on the left once and then step into the vortex to land on top of
it, go around to the back end of the ship where you'll see [Story Scroll]. Now
you can go off the side down the wooden ramp towards the little buildings.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021903]      Ancient Ruins (Undead)      [021903] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

The dangerous bit here is the spiky mines that you can get blown into so try to
run in the opposite direction to whatever the Sheep Mage is doing. Grab the
three keys when they're out and available to grab, hide behind the buildings
when he's blowing or sucking if you like. Once you've got all three unlock the
door on the right side of the area.

Vortex over the gap and jump up to kill a trio of the sword guys as well as a
jellyfish dude at the back. To the left is a Rocket Swap Zone.

 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | There are a lot of moving mines in this rocket zone so be careful when    |
 | zooming along to watch where they're about to move to. The more varied    |
 | pattern ones have a trail of smoke that you can see so you can tell their |
 | general pattern but still watch out for others intersecting with them.    |
 | The reward for reaching the end is a [Winged Sapphire 1/2].               |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up to the right past where the ranged enemy was standing and jump off the
edge into a vortex. Go forwards and then up onto the side of the path where
there's a block next to a vortex, push the block into the vortex and then
follow it in to land on top of it. Continue along the path and jump onto the
first of the rising columns, stay on it and ride it down below where you were
just walking and jump back to the right to get [Golden Sheep 1/3]. Jump back on
the column when it comes down again and this time continue along the columns to
the left.

   ,-------------------------------------------------,
  | [021904]      Cyclops Ship (Undead)      [021904] |
   '-------------------------------------------------'

Walk forwards onto the wooden area and you'll meet another variation on an
enemy. This larger enemy has a shield and you can only damage it when it's
slammed its rams head hammer into the ground. After killing it a few more
enemies will drop in, kill those too to open up the bounce pad at the back.

Before going inside go to the left of the door to an Undead Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Skull Fields (Undead)                                                     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Follow the path along jumping over the flaming skulls as they swing past  |
 | you. Once you get to some enemies you'll want to first kill them and then |
 | watch the rotating skulls ahead before you jump into the vortex as the    |
 | target is directly above the skulls, you'll either hit the ground and     |
 | immediately have to jump or you'll hit the skulls and immediately have to |
 | jump. There's one more group of enemies before you reach the present at   |
 | the end with [Hat 1/3 - Tree Branch] inside.                              |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go inside the building and you'll find a set of drums to bounce on, you need to
jump on all three without hitting the ground. The vortexes are key to reaching
the far two, the vortex on the right goes to the one on the left and the one on
the left goes to the right. Once you've got that sorted head through the exit
that opens up.

   ,------------------------------------------,
  | [021905]      Temple Islands      [021905] |
   '------------------------------------------'

Jump up the platforms to the left and you'll see a vortex being guarded by a
moving mine, easy to get past this one. The next vortex has two mines around it
that might be a little trickier but still just jump into the vortex.

A brand new Vortex Geargolem is introduced now, this one has some unique moves.
First it will occasionally create extra regular enemies to fight against, it'll
also occasionally fire a vortex out ahead of it that, if you get hit by it,
causes you to be teleported directly to the Geargolem and get damaged. It also
has a regular smash attack that it'll quickly perform if you stay too close to
it so make sure to get out of the way whenever it raises its arms up into the
air.

Once it's defeated a large coin will appear in the middle of the area, go over
to it to pick it up and take it over to the door where Blind Beard is standing.
The coin will open the door when you approach, go inside.

  | [021906]      Temple of Wool      [021906] |
   '------------------------------------------'

Towards the left end of the lower level is a block that you can push into a
vortex, do so. Jump in after it and go up the slope to the left, at the top
there's another block, push that left and then down into the vortex again, now
go back down the slope and push the new block to the right a few times until it
falls down and you can use it to reach [Winged Sapphire 2/2].

Back up the slope and pull the lever to raise up a platform from the water, go
right up it and over to a moving vortex, drop into it (it doesn't matter if the
mine explodes when you're in the vortex, it won't hurt) and over the other
side. Go up the rising column at the end and go left to a block puzzle.

Step into the vortex at the right end of it then push the first block down into
another vortex, follow it through and push the next block to the right before
pushing the block below twice so that it falls off the edge. Follow it down off
the edge to the water below and jump through the waterfall to grab [Bonus
Mission Map - Thief on the Run] hiding there. Go back up the column and vortex
back into the puzzle, push the block that's in your way down once and then
finally push the last block to the left and continue up the steps.

The vortex floating about to the left here will just take you up to a Giant
chest that you can open as well as another of those shield enemies if you want
to kill one. Jump back down and head out through the door.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [021907]      Arrr-sheep-elagos      [021907] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

Follow the path down to the right past a couple of mines and then up some
platforms at the end to get to another vortex swirling around with some mines,
jump in and then on the next island jump off into the vortex that's circling
the whole thing. There's a few enemies on the next larger island but not much
more, jump into the vortex at the far end to move on.

This next island though you should ignore the first vortex on the left and
instead jump up the step and go towards the back where there's a second vortex
behind the shipwreck, go in there to be take over to [Treasure Chest 2/3]. The
vortex here will take you right back. Go into the first vortex now and you'll
arrive at the Checkpoint. Buy some abilities if you like in the Power Pod
before moving onwards.

   ,---------------------------------------,
  | [021908]      Itchy Caves      [021908] |
   '---------------------------------------'

After defeating the regular enemies and the Vortex Geargolem the monster gate
will open, go through and kill another two enemies before passing by the first
mine. Take out a few more enemies but then to the right now you can see a
moving vortex, jump off the edge into it to be whisked off to a Sneak Swap
Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Wool Over Their Eyes (Sneak)                                              |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This Sneak Zone is top down, step forwards onto the platform in front of  |
 | you and start spinning it down, on your way to the right watch out for    |
 | the two lasers and then spin down on another platform. If you want the    |
 | bonus gems go left at the spotlight and through a pair of alternating     |
 | lasers. Once you've got it go back along the path of the spotlight and up |
 | to the right where the next platform to lower. The next bonus gem is      |
 | following the next spotlight path downwards instead of upwards, it's      |
 | through a few lasers to the left. With it go up all the way to the and    |
 | and another platform to lower.                                            |
 |                                                                           |
 | The final bonus gem is directly up from the next spotlight track, keep in |
 | the middle to avoid the two lasers that go alongside it. One final        |
 | spotlight to the right awaits, go through it and the lasers to get to a   |
 | platform that this time raises up to the end button. The reward is [Hat   |
 | 2/3 - Aviator's Cap].                                                     |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

The vortex outside the zone will take you right back up again.

   ,---------------------------------------,
  | [021909]      Ram Gallery      [021909] |
   '---------------------------------------'

A block puzzle awaits. Push the first block so that it's in line with the
raised platforms at the back and then the block next to it into the hole on the
right. Jump up onto it and then over left onto the other block and push a block
off the top and into a vortex. Jump down and go to the far end of the section
where there's one last block, push it up twice so that it's directly underneath
the black and purple vortex destination and then go and step into the vortex
that you just pushed a block into, you can now jump to the other vortex on the
platform nearby and teleport on top of that final block.

Don't go inside just yet, you'll again want to go along the side of the
building to find [Golden Sheep 2/3]. Now you can go inside.

The puzzle in here is a tiny bit trickier than the last one but all you need to
do that's different is to directly jump between the near two before jumping
into the vortexes to get the far two. Exit once you've done it.

Now as you get outside go towards the south edge of the platform and you'll
find a vortex just off the edge to jump into, it'll take you up on top of the
building you were in, avoid the mine and open up [Treasure Chest 3/3] before
jumping back down. Jump up along the platforms to the left.

   ,-----------------------------------------------,
  | [021910]      Wooly Caves (Earth)      [021910] |
   '-----------------------------------------------'

Defeat the enemies and then ignore the vortex that's spinning around with some
mines ahead and instead go to the left where there's another vortex floating
above near the edge just below a couple of those ranged cyclopses. It'll take
you up onto their ridge where you can attack them. It's also where the Fire and
Undead Dual Element Gate is found.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Volcano Ride (Fire)                                                       |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Fairly simple concept to this one, get onto the large platform and it'll  |
 | start moving, jump over or move out of the way of the pink glowing skulls |
 | as you pass by them. Same thing again after jumping up some ledges and    |
 | then again after jumping through some vortexes. After one more trip       |
 | through some vortexes at the end you'll find [Hat 3/3 - Creepy Helm].     |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go up to the right and drop off the short wooden platform. Go over the stone
bridge to see the Sheep Mage again. No fight with him this time, just another
set of enemies to kill. Once the Vortex Geargolem is down go to the right side
and pull the lever. Go up the columns that lower and then off into a vortex at
the top. That'll take you over to the last [Golden Sheep 3/3]. The vortex here
will bring you back again.

The left lever just takes you to a bit of gold and some food, ignore it, go
through the monster gate in the middle and into the cave.

Jump up to the right and then go along the far columns (the near ones lead to a
bit of treasure if you want it) and up out of the cave again.

   ,--------------------------------------------------,
  | [021911]      Old Sheep Cliff (Life)      [021911] |
   '--------------------------------------------------'

Kill the shielded enemies that pop out of the ground and then go to the right.
Jump up the moving columns (ignore the vortex, it just leads to a few coins)
all the way to the top where [Legendary Treasure 1/3 - Deputee Badge] is
sitting in a present. Get back down to the coin door where you fought those two
enemies and go left this time.

Another interaction with the giant sheep, try to avoid walking when he's
blowing you around to avoid hitting the mines in the area, keep on going to the
left where you'll spot a Teleport Swap Zone.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Beached Blinkout (Teleport)                                               |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Other than to watch out for the lasers there's not much to say about this |
 | zone. Just try not to get stuck behind the blockades towards the end. The |
 | reward is [Legendary Treasure 2/3 - Urban Art].                           |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

A little further left is a cave entrance. Jump into the vortex and pick up the
giant coin before briefly chatting with Blind Beard and exiting the cave, you
can now either step into the vortex or just jump straight down to the coin door
below.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [021912]      Temple of Baaaaa=      [021912] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

Pull the lever on the left and then step into the lowered vortex, that'll take
you over to the right where you can find the Air Gate.

 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o
 | Lamballoon (Air)                                                          |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | First use the two balloons to get across and then use the flat canvas     |
 | sections as trampolines to bounce along, you'll want to bounce on them a  |
 | couple of times if you don't land far enough across them. The vortex      |
 | after that needs to be timed so that you land on the balloon floating     |
 | about beneath the destination. Kill the Vortex Geargolem that you meet    |
 | and then wait for a vortex to come near you under the mines to teleport   |
 | through them. Jump onto a moving balloon and then along some more         |
 | trampolines, over mines and some more balloons and even more trampolines  |
 | to get up to the present at the end with [Legendary Treasure 3/3 - Amber  |
 | Treasure].                                                                |
 o---------------------------------------------------------------------------o

Go to the left and push the block all the way to the left corner where the
lowered vortex is, now step into the right vortex and start pushing the blocks
off the ledges, the second one you'll have to jump down and push once more to
then jump up onto it to go up the steps.

Only jump past the mines when the giant sheep isn't blowing, otherwise you'll
probably end up hitting the mines. Use the vortex at the end to get up to the
top layer of the area where you'll be fighting some enemies. With the Geargolem
dead the monster gate will open and you can leave to go face the Sheep Mage.

   ,---------------------------------------------,
  | [021913]      Altar of Worsheep      [021913] |
   '---------------------------------------------'

After defeating a couple of waves of enemies Blind Beard will drop a bomb in on
the left side, pick it up and throw it at the giant sheep, you'll have to throw
it directly down the middle or you'll just hit the columns. Once the Sheep Mage
is knocked into the arena make your way through the mines (there's no rush) and
attack him until he gets back up again.

The next couple of waves of enemies are a little bit stronger, just a few more
of those shield enemies though really. Again throw the bomb at the giant sheep
and make your way through a maze of mines to get to the Sheep Mage to hit him.

The last two waves have Geargolems in so might be a bit more tricky, just try
to keep in a position so that you can actually see your Skylander. With the
Sheep Mage down again go through the gaps in the circling mines and finish him
off to complete the adventure.

The difference between Critical Hit % and Critical Hit Multiplier is that the
first affects how often you'll perform a critical hit and the second modifies
how much damage it does.

|~-[040000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~LEGENDARY TREASURES~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~[040000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

In each level you can find one or more Legendary Treasures, these will be
generally found at the end of Elemental Gates or Swap Zones. To activate a
Legendary Treasure and make use of its bonus you must first complete Chapter 6
"Iron Jaw Gulch" of the story mode, you will then be able to use the Legendary
Treasure Pedestals dotted around Woodburrow to place a single Legendary
Treasure.

As there are only a limited number of pedestals you can only use a limited
number of the treasures at one time, so choose the ones that you feel will help
you the most. You can switch the treasure on the pedestal by returning to the
pedestal that the treasure is on and selecting a different treasure, while you
can freely switch treasures you cannot completely empty a pedestal once
something has been placed on it.

'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

After beating Chapter 3 "Mudwater Hollow", Master Eon will unlock the ability
for you to play the Bonus Mission Maps that you can find in the story mode. For
the most effective use I would suggest completing each Bonus Mission as soon as
you have finished the level that you found it in, if you leave them all to do
at the end of the game then their bonuses won't have helped you as much as they
could have done.

|~-[090000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~TIME ATTACK~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~[090000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

After beating the story you unlock a special Time Attack mode where you can run
through a level with a timer ticking, the idea is to get to the end of the
level with as low a time as you can. This can be boosted by picking up tokens
that briefly pause the timer, you can find them in enemies, destructable items
and in the places where you would normally find a collectible. Be aware that
some tokens may take more time to reach and get back to the path than the time
that they save so be smart about which ones you venture to collect.

You will find that you can defeat enemies much quicker when playing in the
easier difficulty modes, this is pretty much necessary to defeat the bosses in
time.

|~-[100000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~SCORE MODE~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-[100000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

After beating the story you unlock a special Score Mode where you can run
through a level earning points for your actions. The idea is to defeat as many
enemies as you can and get hit as few times as possible to keep your multiplier
high so that you get more points for each enemy you defeat.

You'll also want to pick up coins for a few extra points, necessary for
maximising your score but probably unnecessary for getting the 3 stars. Note
that gold boost stats do not effect the amount of points you get from coins, so
for example if an item is worth 10 gold normally but 13 gold with a boost it'll
still be worth just 10 points to the score (and then multiplied by your current
multiplier of course) even though your Skylander gains 13 gold.

The higher the difficulty setting the more points an enemy is worth when you
defeat them (except Chompies, they're always worth 1 point no matter the
difficulty). For example a Fire Golem is worth 270 points on Easy, 450 on
Medium, 608 on Hard and a whopping 1125 points on Nightmare. Another advantage
to playing on harder difficulties is that as the enemies have higher health you
will get more multiplier bonus from hitting them.

Your multiplier can go up to x30, you'll want to try to get there as early as
you can to maximise the points you're getting. Do not let your active Skylander
get defeated as that will reduce your multiplier back down to x1, if in danger
of losing all your health switch to a different Skylander and you'll retain the
multiplier (though you will lose the protective shield if you have it). Once
you've hit x30 picking up extra x1 tokens will only earn you 300 points so it
may not be worth going into gates and zones for such small rewards but of
course every little helps to maximise your score.

The damaging Magic Items are not very helpful in Score Mode, the damage they do
does not contribute to your multiplier bonus and if they get the final blow on
the enemy you do not get any points for killing it at all (the same actually
applies if an enemy kills another enemy). The coins earned from the Hidden
Treasure and the Sky Diamond do both contribute to the score though and of
course the Healing Elixir, Time Twist Hourglass, Winged Boots and Sky Iron
Shield still work just the same as they do in regular play and are just as
useful here. It is also worth noting that the blast from a Lightcore Skylander
does indeed contribute to the score and multiplier so you can use them without
worry.

|~-[110000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~PORTAL MASTER RANK~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-[110000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

Your Portal Master Rank shows you how much progress you've made completing
every part of Skylanders: Swap Force. You earn a new rank every six stars that
you earn, up to a maximum of level 80. There are many more stars than are
needed to reach level 80 so you have plenty of options of things to do to get
there.

Stars are earnt through completing tasks, these range from the level completion
stars in Story Mode to simply owning several different characters. To check
your rank after completing Chapter 3 pause the game and go to Portal Master,
your rank is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. To see what stars
you can still earn go into each icon and look around.

One thing to note is the stars listed for the arena battles includes stars for
levels that are unlocked with the Sheep Wreck Island and Arkeyan Crossbow
pieces but also be aware that stars earned in Solo Survival are different to
stars earned in Team Survival.

Here's a table listing all of the things that you can unlock with your Portal
Master Rank and when.

|~-[120000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~QUESTS~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-[120000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

A special set of tasks that each Skylander can do to earn bonus health. The
Quests are similar to those found in Skylanders: Giants but you'll find that
they're completely seperate and progress in one game does not apply to the
other. Each rank takes three completed quests and gives you +25 health, so with
three ranks that's a total of +75 health you can earn.

If you have completed enough quests in Giants to get a rank you will still see
the icon for it but you cannot check the progress on those quests in Swap
Force.

  |        TITLE        |                    REQUIREMENT                    |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | Badguy Basher       | Defeat 1000 enemies.                              |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Arenas have plenty of enemies to kill, try the ones with plenty of      |
  | Chompies like Angry Angry Plants.                                       |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Fruit Frontiersman  | Eat 15 fruits in Story Levels or Arenas.          |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Despite the description of the quest food picked up in the Bonus        |
  | Missions does count, and there's plenty of fruit in there. That said    |
  | the fruit in the Bonus Mission Fruit Fight does not count, for obvious  |
  | reasons.                                                                |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Flawless Challenger | Complete a non-Story Mode level with full health. |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | That means that at the very end of the level you must have full health  |
  | and not that you cannot take any damage.                                |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | True Gladiator      | Win 10 PVP matches.                               |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | The quickest win is by your opponent jumping off the edge in Ring Out.  |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Totally Maxed Out   | Reach level 20 and purchase all Upgrades for this |
  |                     | Skylander.                                        |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | The higher the difficulty the more XP you earn.                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Elementalist        | Cause 7500 elemental bonus damage.                |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | To maximise the damage you're doing have your Skylander wear an         |
  | Elemental Power hat and activate any Legendary Treasures you have for   |
  | it too. These are the quickest levels for each element to reach a zone  |
  | of their type:                                                          |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  | Life: Kaos' Fortress                                                    |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Magic: Iron Jaw Gulch                                                   |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Tech: Twisty Tunnels                                                    |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Undead: Motleyville                                                     |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| without killing any of the chompies or the Heaver outside. Keep going back  |
| in to get another stick to throw at the enemies, also go through the gate   |
| that you're supposed to blow up and get the enemies there. Shouldn't take   |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time consuming. There's a Spark Lock in Woodburrow you can keep reloading   |
| to do.                                                                      |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You need to be at health where it's red and flashing. Probably the most     |

And each Skylander has their own personal quest. All versions of the same
character have the same quest so, for example, a Series 1 Stealth Elf has the
same set of quests as a Series 3 Ninja Stealth Elf.

For the swappable Skylanders the quests are held in the top half so you can use
any bottom half you like when completing them.

|   SKYLANDER    |            TITLE            |         REQUIREMENT          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bash           | On a Roll                   | Defeat 10 enemies with one   |
|                |                             | roll attack.                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wait for a load of Chompies to group around you, an arena should be good.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blast Zone     | If You Can't Stand the Heat | Defeat a total of 10 enemies |
|                |                             | from your flame wall in a    |
|                |                             | single use of your Flame     |
|                |                             | Breath.                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wait for a load of Chompies to group around you, an arena should be good.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boom Jet       | Tactical Strikes            | Defeat 747 enemies with your |
|                |                             | Air Strike ability.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| It's just going to be time consuming, the easiest enemies to kill with it   |
| are obviously Chompies.                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boomer         | On a Troll                  | Defeat 100 enemies with      |
|                |                             | kicked Troll Bombs.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You have to actually kick the bomb, just leaving it sitting there won't     |
| count.                                                                      |

|                |                             | Fists of Destruction.        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elemental Power can help speed this up, face slightly away from your target |
| so as to do less damage with the bullets before turning to fire the fists   |
| at them.                                                                    |

| Bumble Blast   | Not the Bees!               | Hit honey-coated enemies     |
|                |                             | with bees 125 times.         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The hits don't have to kill them so it may be quicker to do on larger       |
| enemies.                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Camo           | Garden Gorger               | Eat 10 watermelons.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Switch Camo in every time you see one, but don't take him off again too     |
| quickly otherwise he'll forget he ate it. To force a save you can just      |
| change his hat. Try the Chompy Challenge, Undercover Greebles or Cursed     |
| Statues for watermelons.                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chill          | Ice Sore                    | Defeat 50 enemies with the   |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pretty straightforward.                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pretty straightforward.                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Countdown      | Out With a Bang             | Defeat 10 enemies at once    |
|                |                             | with your Self-Destruct      |
|                |                             | explosion ability.           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gather up Chompies to take them out in one blast.                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crusher        | High Roller                 | Defeat 100 enemies with      |
|                |                             | boulders.                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| By boulders it means the Rockslide ability. Easier with the Soul Gem        |
| upgrade to steer yourself.                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cynder         | On the Haunt                | Defeat 50 enemies with your  |
|                |                             | Ghost Ally.                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The ghosts you leave behind when dashing are Ghost Allies, dash through     |
| Chompies to get this quickly.                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dino-Rang      | Fooderang                   | Pick up 20 Fruit Kabobs.     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Switch Dino-Rang in every time you see one, but don't take him off again    |
| too quickly otherwise he'll forget he ate it. To force a save you can just  |
| change his hat.                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Doom Stone     | ???                         | ???                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Double Trouble | Big Bomb Trouble            | Defeat 10 enemies with one   |
|                |                             | Magic Bomb Summoning.        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Get in an arena and let Chompies swarm up on you to defeat them in one      |
| blast. As the radius is quite small you'll have to be right in the middle   |
| of them.                                                                    |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bonus Mission Royal Gems has plenty of Spell Punks to defeat. The Series 2  |
| Wow Pow interferes with this as killing a Spell Punk with its new attack    |
| does not count, luckily every other shot is a regular auto-blaster shot so  |
| you should get the credit as long as that hits last.                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drobot         | Feel the Burn               | Defeat 50 enemies with After |
|                |                             | Burners.                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If you're having trouble circling around just use the hover mode to move    |
| close so that the enemies are behind you, let go of it to carry on burning. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dune Bug       | That's How I Roll           | Roll your Dune Ball a total  |
|                |                             | of 5,000 feet.               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hold down the Dune Ball button and keep circling around the Woodburrow      |
| pool.                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Eruptor        | Pizza Burp                  | Eat 10 pizzas.               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Switch Eruptor in every time you see one, but don't take him off again too  |
| quickly otherwise he'll forget he ate it. To force a save you can just      |
| change his hat. The Food Thief should have plenty of Pizza.                 |

| Eye-Brawl      | Gold Search                 | Collect 750 gold with your   |
|                |                             | eyeball detached.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Once you've got the "Headless, Not Helpless" upgrade Eye-Brawl's body will  |
| move slightly forwards when punching so stand near some coins and try to    |
| lure it into picking them up.                                               |

| Fire Kraken    | Don't Rain On My Parade     | Knock back enemies 10 times  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That can be ten different enemies, and killing an enemy still knocks it     |
| back so Chompies are of course your best bet.                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flameslinger   | Circular Combustion         | Eat 50 Hamburgers.           |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sit in the middle of an arena with loads of Chompies and hold down the      |
| Crystal Lighthouse attack until the quest pops.                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free Ranger    | Ruffled Feathers            | Hit enemies 25 times without |
|                |                             | stopping your melee attacks. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keep tapping the attack button even if you're swinging at thin air, 25      |
| should be easy to do in a Chompy infested arena.                            |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As with everything else Chompies in arenas will be easiest.                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gill Grunt     | Anchors Away!               | Defeat 50 enemies with the   |

| Grilla Drilla  | Monkey's Mean Business      | Deal a total of 2000 damage  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elemental Power can help speed this up.                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grim Creeper   | Aggressive Outfit           | Hit 10 enemies in a row with |
|                |                             | your armor while it travels  |
|                |                             | back to you.                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Because you'll want to live go to Easy mode and attack a group of ten       |
| Chompies, you don't need to mark all ten just to hit them so one big ground |
| should do the trick.                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|                |                             | your Skull Shield.           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The only trouble here is that you move really slowly when using the attack, |
| and then that the enemies killed by the skulls after they fly off don't     |
| count.                                                                      |

|                |                             | Flashback attack.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Soul Gem upgrade does not help with this as only one of the three       |
| DejaBOOM projectiles will explode at the end, which means you'll end up     |
| killing more Chompies but still only get one that counts.                   |

| Hot Dog        | Animal Aggravator           | Eat 10 Hot Dogs.             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hot Dogs are kinda rare, Bonus Missions Chompy Sauce, Fishy Fishing and     |
| Master Chef should have a few.                                              |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| It'll maybe take fifteen laps around the Woodburrow pool. I'd suggest going |
| clockwise so you can see the folk standing in the way.                      |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fly around the Woodburrow pool about fifteen times, to speed up the         |
| recharge use the suction gun.                                               |

| Lightning Rod  | Current Event               | Defeat 50 Golems.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Golem Invasion is the perfect Bonus Mission for this one.                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|                |                             | Polarized Pickup.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shouldn't take long with Elemental Power.                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Night Shift    | King of the Ring            | Hit 10 enemies at once with  |
|                |                             | your giant uppercut punch.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That's from the Don't Move, Just Stick! upgrade. It might be a bit tricky   |
| getting enough enemies in range to do this so just keep on trying.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ninjini        | Bottle Beatdown             | Defeat 10 Golems using       |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Golem Invasion Bonus Mission should be a good place to do this.         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pop Fizz       | Rampage                     | Deal 200 damage in a single  |
|                |                             | run in Beast Form.           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That amount is kind of pathetic, if you haven't got it accidentally then    |
| you've probably just never used Beast Form.                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sit in the middle of an arena holding down the breath attack button,        |

|                |                             | using the Drill Head attack. |

|                |                             | performing a Self-Slingshot. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The tricky part is just to find yourself a watermelon, Bonus Missions       |
| Chompy Challenge, Undercover Greebles or Cursed Statues should have one or  |
| two.                                                                        |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plenty of levels, arenas a bonus missions have Greebles in them.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slobber Tooth  | Hungry Like a Hippo         | Swallow 25 enemies.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That means eating the enemy and then waiting for it to digest inside you    |
| instead of throwing it back out. Which does mean that enemies that die in   |
| one hit won't be of any help.                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Smolderdash    | Event Horizon               | Knock a total of 50 enemies  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Solar Orb only knocks enemies into the air when you detonate it.        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sonic Boom     | Sonic Squeak                | Babies defeat 50 enemies.    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set them free on some Chompies.                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|                |                             | Landmine Golf attack.        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chompies for this one too.                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spy Rise       | Finishing Touch             | Spyder Sting 25 enemies.     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An enemy that can be hit with the Spyder Sting attack will have a fist icon |
| appear next to them, get close and you can defeat them in one hit.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spyro          | Full Charge                 | Collect 3 gold, eat 1 food   |
|                |                             | item, and defeat 2 enemies   |
|                |                             | in 1 Spring Charge.          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The first thing is to find a good location for this, one that I used is in  |
| Ghost Traps, the second set of Gazermages have some crates with coins in    |
| and a piece of food nearby too. Destroy the crates first and hit the mages  |
| a couple of times with the flame attack so that your charge kills them.     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Star Strike    | Deflection Master           | Deflect the Returning Star   |
|                |                             | 20 times in a row.           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You can just sit there bouncing it, no enemies required.                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stealth Elf    | Stealth Health              | Gain 1000 HP while           |
|                |                             | stealthed.                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stealth into food a few times, you do need to be damaged to have it count   |
| though.                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stink Bomb     | What's That Smell?          | Nauseate enemies 50 times    |
|                |                             | with your One-Inch Palm.     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shouldn't be too difficult, you can even do it to the same enemy more than  |
| once.                                                                       |

|                |                             | Thornbark.                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Since you need to take damage to deal damage with Thornbark you might want  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The Dangerous Waters upgrades triggers this. Since the fish only do damage  |
| once the enemy is in the bubble Chompies will be useless for this quest.    |
| All the fish needs is the final blow so you can pre-damage the enemy before |
| putting them into the bubble and waiting for them to die.                   |

| Gather some Chompies up and hold down the attack, it should be able to hit  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That would be when you're fully wound up and wind up again, spin into       |
| enemies or detonate to do the damage.                                       |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The automatic electrification upgrade is of course helpful here but it's    |
| not necessary.                                                              |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| That does mean waiting all the way until the boar disappears by itself, no  |
| jumping off. The number of enemies you kill on each run doesn't affect the  |
| number of completions for this quest. So killing 20 Chompies in one run     |
| would still only up the count by one.                                       |

| After beating the story mode you will unlock Time Attack. Replay through    |
| any chapter you like and reach the end, the time achieved does not matter   |
| for this one.                                                               |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The quickest way of getting this is to switch to Easy difficulty and        |
| complete a boss chapter as they are fairly short - doing them on higher     |
| difficulties just ups the amount of time taken. If you do a proper level    |
| try to restrict going into elemental gates as although they give a time     |
| pause token they generally take longer to complete than the time you earn   |
| back.                                                                       |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Again Easy difficulty is going to be very helpful in getting through the    |
| enemies quickly. Skip any enemies that take more than a hit or two unless   |
| they are needed to open a Monster Gate.                                     |

| After beating the story mode you will unlock Score Mode. Replay through any |
| chapter you like and reach the end, the score achieved does not matter for  |
| this one.                                                                   |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The harder the difficulty the more points you earn from defeating an enemy  |
| and the more multiplier energy you get from hitting them, but also you will |
| have to take longer to defeat them which gives them more time to hit you    |
| and lower your multiplier bonus. You want to try to get to the x30 max as   |
| quickly as possible so go into all the elemental gates, swap zones and      |
| secret areas to pick up the multiplier tokens - at least until you've hit   |
| x30, after that the tokens aren't worth very much and may not be worth your |
| time. Do not let your Skylander die otherwise the multiplier will go back   |
| to x1, instead swap them out if you're having trouble.                      |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Like the Score Mode you will get more points on higher difficulty settings, |
| try to build up your multiplier to its max as quickly as possible and keep  |
| it there.                                                                   |

| As with Score Mode and Bonus Missions you get more points if you're on a    |
| higher difficulty, balance that between the time taken to defeat the        |
| enemies and the number of times you are hit. If you're doing this solo then |
| try to get rid of the other Skylander as quickly as possible to not damage  |
| your multiplier bonus.                                                      |

|~-[150000]~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-[150000]-~|
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

      Q: What do the stats on the Trading Cards mean?

A: The stats on the cards do not correspond to any of the character's in-game
statistics but this is what the icons mean:

    * The fist is Attack.
    * The shield is Defense.
    * The running figure is Agility.
    * The clover is Luck.

      Q: Where are the Heroic Challenges?

A: There are no Heroic Challenges in Swap Force. Bonus Missions have replaced
their stat boosting ability.

      Q: Do the Adventure Packs make up any of the percentage complete
      statistic on the load save screen?

A: No, the Adventure Packs are purely extras.

      Q: What elements come with the Adventure Packs?

A: They are as following:

    * Tower of Time = Air (Pop Thorn)
    * Sheep Wreck Island = Tech (Wind-Up)

      Q: But what about the accolades!?

A: The accolades are very detailed, you'll need all of the Skylanders and all
of the Adventure Packs to get them all.

      Q: Where do I find the entrances to the Adventure Pack levels?

A: Once you've placed the toy on the Portal you can find the Tower of Time on
the right side of Woodburrow just to the right of the training dummies.

      Q: What is a good way to earn money?

A: If you like to earn your money I'd suggest playing through Arenas and Bonus
Missions as well as collecting from places dotted around Woodburrow like the
Elemental Chest inside the Great Hollow, the Spark Lock inside the Great Hollow
and a platform next to the training dummies that a rainbow bridge appears next
to between 3PM and 6PM.

But if just want money as quickly as possible and happen to own the Sky Diamond
from the Tower of Time Adventure Pack then you can attack the training dummies
in Woodburrow and they'll drop the bonus diamond for every single time you hit
them (with the Sky Diamond on the portal of course) which if you're using a
Skylander with an automatic rapid fire attack will quickly add up. You can use
co-op to get the money on a second Skylander at the same time as well.

      Q: What is a good way to level up?

A: Defeat enemies in harder difficulty modes. Bonus Missions and Arenas are
good places to get extra exp, remember to equip the bonus experience Legendary
Treasures. Sunday's daily bonus is double exp so that is a good day to be
levelling up.

      Q: What are all of the Message of the Day bonuses?

A: In Woodburrow after completing Chapter 5 you can interact with a signpost at
the start of Woodburrow to activate a bonus boost. This only works when
connected to the internet. The boosts are as follows:

    * Sunday: Double XP (+100 XP Bonus)
    * Monday: +10 Speed
    * Tuesday: +10 XP Boost
    * Wednesday: +30 Maximum Health
    * Thursday: +10 Gold Boost
    * Friday: +10 Armor
    * Saturday: +10 Elemental Power

      Q: My Portal of Power / Skylander isn't working! What do I do?

A: First try moving it away from any metal surfaces as they can interfere with
the portal. You may also find that Skylanders placed very near to the portal
can affect the game so if you are having problems try moving your Skylanders
away from the portal when not using them. If that doesn't work you will
probably need to contact Activision Support through one of the following
